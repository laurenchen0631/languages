# Construction, Cleanup, Copy, and Move

```c++
string ident(string arg) // string passed by value (copied into arg)
{
  return arg; // return string (move the value of arg out of ident() to a caller)
}

int main ()
{
  string s1 {"Adams"};      // initialize string (construct in s1).
  s1 = indet(s1);           // copy s1 into ident() 
                            // move the result of ident(s1) into s1;
                            // s1’s value is "Adams".
  string s2 {"Pratchett"};  // initialize string (construct in s2)
  s1 = s2;                  // copy the value of s2 into s1
                            // both s1 and s2 have the value "Pratchett".
```
- Several functions are used here:
  - A constructor initializing a string with a string literal (used for `s1` and `s2`)
  - A copy constructor copying a string (into the function argument `arg`)
  - A move constructor moving the value of a string (from arg out of `ident()` into a temporary variable holding the result of `ident(s1)`)
  - A move assignment moving the value of a string (from the temporary variable holding the result of `ident(s1)` into `s1`)
  - A copy assignment copying a string (from `s2` into `s1`)
  - A destructor releasing the resources owned by `s1`, `s2`, and the temporary variable holding the result of `ident(s1)`.

## Constructors and Destructors
```c++
struct Tracer {
  string mess;
  Tracer(const string& s) :mess{s} { clog << mess; }
  ~Tracer() {clog << "~" << mess; }
};

void f(const vector<int>& v)
{
  Tracer tr {"in f()\n"};
  for (auto x : v) {
    Tracer tr {string{"v loop "}+to<string>(x)+'\n'};
    // ...
  }
}

int main() {
  f({2,3,5});
  // in_f()
  // v loop 2
  // ~v loop 2
  // v loop 3
  // ~v loop 3
  // v loop 5
  // ~v loop 5
  // ~in_f()
}
```
- Some of the most effective techniques for resource management in C++ rely on constructor/destructor pairs.
- A constructor builds a class object ‘‘from the bottom up’’:
  1. the constructor invokes its base class constructors.
  2. it invokes the member constructors.
  3. it executes its own body.
- A destructor ‘‘tears down’’ an object in the reverse order
  1. the destructor executes its own body.
  2. it invokes its member destructors.
  3. it invokes its base class destructors. 
- Constructors execute member and base constructors **in declaration order**.
```c++
class Vector {
public:
  Vector(int s);
  // ...
};

struct S {
  S(); // fine
  void S(int);  // error : no type can be specified for a constructor 
  int S; // error : the class name must denote a constructor 
  enum S { foo, bar }; // error : the class name must denote a constructor
};
``` 
- A member with the same name as its class is called a *constructor*.
- A constructor declaration specifies an argument list but has **no return type**.
- The name of a class cannot be used for an ordinary member.
```c++
class Vector {
public:
  Vector(int s);
  // ...
private:
  double* elem; // elem points to an array of sz doubles
  int sz; // sz is non-negative
};

Vector::Vector(int s)
{
  if (s<0) throw Bad_size{s};
  sz = s;
  elem = new double[s];
}
``` 
- Initialization must establish a class **invariant**, that is, something that must hold whenever a member function is called.
  - It focuses the design effort for the class 
  - It clarifies the behavior of the class (e.g., under error conditions)
  - It simplifies the definition of member functions
  - It clarifies the class’s management of resources
  - It simplifies the documentation of the class
- If a constructor cannot establish the invariant, it should throw an exception.
  - No object is created
  - The constructor must ensure that no resources are leaked
- Wherever possible
  - Establish an invariant in a constructor
  - Maintain the invariant with copy and move operations
  - Do any needed cleanup in the destructor
```c++
class Vector {
public:
  Vector(int s) :elem{new double[s]}, sz{s} { }; // constructor: acquire memory
  ~Vector() { delete[] elem; } // destructor: release memory
  // ...
private:
  double* elem; // elem points to an array of sz doubles
  int sz; // sz is non-negative
};

Vector* f(int s)
{
  Vector v1(s);
  // ...
  return new Vector(s+s);
}

void g(int ss)
{
  Vector* p = f(ss);
  // ...
  delete p;
}
```
- Some classes need a function that is guaranteed to be invoked when an object is destroyed. Such a function is called a *destructor*.
- The name of a destructor is `~` followed by the class name.
- A destructor **does not take an argument**, and a class can have only one destructor.
```c++
void C::push_back(const X& a)
{
  // ...
  new(p) X{a}; // copy construct an X with the value a in address p
  // ...
}

void C::pop_back()
{
  // ...
  p−>~X(); // destroy the X in address p
}
``` 
- There are rare (but important) cases where a destructor must be called explicitly.
- `p−>~X()` notation invokes `X`’s destructor for `*p`
```c++
class Nonlocal {
public:
  // ...
  void destroy() { this−>~Nonlocal(); } // explicit destruction
private:
  // ...
  ~Nonlocal(); // don’t destroy implicitly
};

void user()
{
  Nonlocal x;
  X* p = new Nonlocal;
  // ...
  delete p;
  p.destroy(); 
}
``` 
- We can prevent destruction of an `X` by declaring its destructor `=delete` or `private`.
  - Of the two alternatives, using `private` is the more ﬂexible.
- We can create a class for which objects can be explicitly destroyed, but not implicitly.
```c++
class Shape {
public:
  // ...
  virtual void draw() = 0;
  virtual ~Shape();
};

class Circle {
public:
  // ...
  void draw();
  ~Circle(); // overrides ~Shape()
  // ...
};

void user(Shape* p)
{
  p−>draw(); // invoke the appropriate draw()
  // ...
  delete p; // invoke the appropriate destructor
};
```
- A destructor can be declared to be `virtual`.
- The reason we need a `virtual` destructor is that **an object usually manipulated through the interface provided by a base class is often also deleted through that interface**.
  - Had `Shape`’s destructor not been `virtual` that `delete` would have failed to invoke the appropriate derived class destructor.

## Initialization Without Constructors
- We cannot define a constructor for a built-in type, yet we can initialize it with a value.
- We can initialize objects of a class for which we have not defined a constructor using
  - *memberwise* initialization
  - *copy* initialization
  - *default* initialization
```c++
struct Work {
  string author;
  string name; 
  int year;
};

Work s9 {
  "Beethoven",
  "Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125; Choral",
  1824 
}; // memberwise initialization

Work currently_playing { s9 }; // copy initialization
Work none {};  // default initialization
``` 
- The three members of `currently_playing` are copies of those of `s9`.
- The default initialization of using `{}` is defined as **initialization of each member by `{}`**. So, none is initialized to `{{},{},{}}`, which is `{"","",0}`
- Memberwise initialization works only if we can access the members (not `private`).
- If a class has a private non-static data member, it needs a constructor to initialize it.
```c++
Work alpha;

void f()
{
  Work beta;
  // ...
}
``` 
- Where no constructor requiring arguments is declared, it is also possible to **leave out the initializer completely**.
- For **statically allocated objects**, the rules are exactly as if you had used `{}`, so the value of alpha is `{"","",0}`.
- For **local variables and free-store objects**, the default initialization is done only for members of class type, and **members of built-in type are left uninitialized**, so the value of beta is `{"","",unknown}`.
```c++
struct Buf {
  int count;
  char buf[16*1024];
};

Buf buf0; // statically allocated, so initialized by default

void f()
{
  Buf buf1; // leave elements uninitialized
  Buf buf2 {}; // I really want to zero out those elements

  int* p1 = new int; // *p1 is uninitialized
  int* p2 = new int{}; // *p2 == 0
  int* p3 = new int{7}; // *p3 == 7
  // ...
}
``` 
- We don't initialize `Buf` for performance.
- If you want guaranteed initialization or simply dislike surprises, supply an initializer `{}`.

## Initialization Using Constructors
- Where memberwise copy is not sufficient or desirable, a constructor should be defined.
- A constructor is often used to **establish an invariant** for its class and to **acquire resources** necessary to do that.
```c++
struct X {
  X(int);
};

X x0; // error: no initializer 
X x1 {}; // error: empty initializer
X x2 {2}; // OK
X x3 {"two"}; // error: wrong initializer type
X x4 {1,2}; // error: wrong number of initializers
X x5 {x4}; // OK: a copy constructor is implicitly defined

struct Y : X {
  X m {0}; // provide default initializer for member m
  Y(int a) :X{a}, m{a} { }; // initialize base and member
  Y() : X{0} { }; // initialize base and member
};

X g {1}; // initialize global variable

void f(int a)
{
  X def {}; // error : no default value for 
  Y de2 {}; X // OK: use default constructor
  X* p {nullptr};
  X var {2}; // initialize local variable
  p = new X{4}; // initialize object on free store 
  X a[] {1,2,3}; // initialize array elements
  vector<X> v {1,2,3,4};  // initialize vector elements
}
``` 
- **Default constructor disappears when you define a constructor**
- However, the copy constructor does not disappear.
- The usual overload resolution rules apply for constructors.
- The `{}` notation for initialization can be used to provide arguments to a constructor. For this reason, `{}` initialization is sometimes referred to as *universal initialization*.
- `{}` initialization is *uniform*: wherever you initialize an object of type `X` with a value `v` using the `{v}` notation, the same value of type `X (X{v})` is created.
- `{}`-initializer notation does not allow narrowing. That is another reason to prefer the `{}`.
```c++
struct Y : X {
  X m;
  Y(int a) : X(a), m=a { }; // syntax error: can’t use = for member initialization
};

X g(1); // initialize global variable

void f(int a)
{ 
  X def(); // function returning an X (surprise!?)
  X* p {nullptr};
  X var = 2; // initialize local variable
  p = new X=4; // syntax error: can’t use = for new 
  X a[](1,2,3); // error : can’t use () for array initialization 
  vector<X> v(1,2,3,4); // error : can’t use () for list elements
}
``` 
```c++
struct S1 {
  int a,b; // no constructor
};

struct S2 {
  int a,b;
  S2(int a = 0, int b = 0) : a(aa), b(bb) {} // constructor
};

S1 x11(1,2); // error: no constructor
S1 x12 {1,2};  // OK: memberwise initialization

S1 x13(1); // error: no constructor
S1 x14 {1};  // OK: x14.b becomes 0

S2 x21(1,2); // OK: use constructor
S2 x22 {1,2};  // OK: use constructor

S2 x23(1); // OK: use constructor and one default argument 
S2 x24 {1}; // OK: use constructor and one default argument
```
- The `=` and `()` notations for initialization are not universal.
- The `=` and `()` notations for initialization are not uniform either.
- **Using the `()` notation, you can request to use a constructor** rather than get the memberwise initialization or initializer-list initialization that the `{}` notation also offers.
```c++
vector<string> v1 {77}; // 77 elements with the default value ""
                        // (vector<string>(std::initializer_list<string>) doesn’t accept {77})
vector<string> v2(77); // 77 elements with the default value ""

vector<string> v3 {"Booh!"}; // one element with the value "Booh!"
vector<string> v4("Booh!"); // error : no constructor takes a string argument

vector<int*> v5 {100,0}; // 100 int*s initialized to nullptr (100 is not an int*)

vector<int*> v6 {0,0}; // 2 int*s initialized to nullptr
vector<int*> v7(0,0);  // empty vector (v7.size()==0)
vector<int*> v8; // empty vector (v7.size()==0)
``` 
- We occasionally must use `()` initialization for vectors
***
- Default Constructors
  ```c++
  class Vector {
  public:
    Vector(); // default constructor: no elements
    // ... 
  };

  Vector v1; // OK
  Vector v2 {}; // OK
  ```
  - A constructor that can be invoked without an argument is called a *default constructor*.
    - A default argument can make a constructor that takes arguments into a default constructor.
    - **References and consts** must be initialized. Therefore, a class containing such members cannot be default constructed.
  - A default constructor is used if no arguments are specified or if an empty initializer list is provided.
  ```c++
  void f() {
    int a0; // uninitialized
    int a1();  // function declaration (intended?)

    int a {}; // a becomes 0
    double d {};  // d becomes 0.0 
    char∗ p {}; // p becomes nullptr

    int∗ p1 = new int; // uninitialized int
    int∗ p2 = new int{}; // the int is initialized to 0
  }
  ``` 
  - For a built-in type the default constructor is not invoked for uninitialized non-static variables.
  ```c++
  template<class T>
  struct Handle {
    T∗ p;
    Handle(T∗ pp = new T{}) :p{pp} { }
    // ...
  };

  Handle<int> px; // will generate int{}
  ```
  - Constructors for built-in types are most often used for template arguments. 
  ```c++
  struct S1 { S1(); }; // has default constructor
  struct S2 { S2(string); }; // no default constructor

  S1 a1[10]; // OK: 10 default elements
  S2 a2[10];  // error : cannot initialize elements
  S2 a3[] { "alpha", "beta" }; // OK: two elements: S2{"alpha"}, S2{"beta"}

  vector<S1> v1(10); // OK: 10 default elements
  vector<S2> v2(10); // error : cannot initialize elements
  vector<S2> v3 { "alpha", "beta" }; // OK: two elements: S2{"alpha"}, S2{"beta"}

  vector<S2> v2(10,""); // OK: 10 elements each initialized to S2{""}
  vector<S2> v4;  // OK: no elements
  ``` 
  - A default constructor is required for a class used as the element type of a `vector` or array.
***
- Initializer-List Constructors
  - A constructor that takes **a single argument of type** `std::initializer_list` is called an *initializer-list constructor*.
  - The initializer list can be of arbitrary length but must be homogeneous.
  - For selecting a constructor, **default and initializer lists take precedence**.
    - If we really want to invoke the constructor taking one or two integer arguments, we must use the `()` notation.
  ```c++
  vector<double> v = { 1, 2, 3.456, 99.99 };

  list<pair<string,string>> languages = {
    {"Nygaard","Simula"}, {"Richards","BCPL"}, {"Ritchie","C"}
  };

  map<vector<string>,vector<int>> years = {
    { {"Maurice","Vincent", "Wilkes"},{1913, 1945, 1951, 1967, 2000} },
    { {"Martin", "Richards"} {1982, 2003, 2007} },
    { {"David", "John", "Wheeler"}, {1927, 1947, 1951, 2004} }
  };
  ``` 
  - Standard-library containers (e.g., `vector` and `map`) have initializer-list constructors, assignments, etc.
  ```c++
  void f(initializer_list<int> args)
  {
    for (int i = 0; i!=args.size(); ++i)
      cout << args.begin()[i] << "\n";
  }

  void f(initializer_list<int> args)
  {
    for (auto p=args.begin(); p!=args.end(); ++p)
    cout << ∗p << "\n";
  }

  void f(initializer_list<int> args)
  {
    for (auto x : args)
    cout << x << "\n";
  }
  ```
  - `initializer_list<T>` argument can access it as a sequence using the member functions `begin()`, `end()`, and `size()`.
  - `initializer_list` **doesn’t** provide subscripting.
  - An `initializer_list<T>` is passed by value since it is just a small handle (typically two words) to an array of `T`s.
  - To explicitly use it, you must `#include <initializer_list>`.
  - The elements of an `initializer_list` are **immutable**.
    - we cannot apply a move constructor.
  ```C++
  template<class E>
  class Vector {
  public:
    Vector(std::initializer_list<E> s); // initializer-list constructor
    // ...
  private:
    int sz;
    E∗ elem;
  };

  template<class E>
  Vector::Vector(std::initializer_list<E> s)
    :sz{s.size()} // set vector size
  {
    reserve(sz); // get the right amount of space
    uninitialized_copy(s.begin(), s.end(), elem); // initialize elements in elem[0:s.size())
  }
  ```

## Member and Base Initialization
```c++
class Club {
  string name;
  vector<string> members;
  vector<string> officers;
  Date founded;
  // ...
  Club(const string& n, Date fd);
};

Club::Club(const string& n, Date fd)
  : name{n}, members{}, officers{}, founded{fd}
{
  // ... 
}
```
- Arguments for a member’s constructor are specified in a *member initializer list* in the definition of the constructor.
- The member initializer list **starts with `:`**, and the members are separated by `,`.
- The **members’ constructors are called before the body** of the containing class’s own constructor is executed.
- The constructors are called in the **order in which the members are declared in the class** rather than the order in which the members appear in the initializer list.
  - To avoid confusion, **it is best to specify the initializers in the member declaration order**.
```c++
class Person {
  string name;
  string address;
  // ...

  Person(const Person&);
  Person(const string& n, const string& a);
};

Person::Person(const string& n, const string& a)
  : name{n}
{
  address = a;
}
``` 
- Member initializers are different from that of assignment.
- We prefer to use the member initializer syntax to make it explicit that initialization is being done.
- Often, there also is an **efficiency advantage** to using the initializer syntax
  - In the example, `address` is **first initialized to the empty string** and then a copy of `a` is assigned.
```c++
class B1 { B1(); }; // has default constructor
class B2 { B2(int); } // no default constructor

struct D1 : B1, B2 {
  D1(int i) :B1{}, B2{i} {}
};

struct D2 : B1, B2 {
  D2(int i) :B2{i} {} // B1{} is used implicitly
};

struct D1 : B1, B2 {
  D1(int i) { }  // error : B2 requires an int initializer
};

struct B { B(int); /* ... */};
struct BB : B { /* ... */ };
struct BBB : BB {
  BBB(int i) : B(i) { }; // error: trying to initialize base’s base
  // ... 
};
```
- Bases of a derived class are initialized in the same way non-data members are.
- If a base requires an initializer, it must be provided as a base initializer in a constructor
- As with members, the order of initialization is the declaration order.
- A constructor can **initialize members and bases of its class**, but not members or bases of its members.
```c++
class X {
  int a;
  validate(int x) { if (0<x && x<=max) a=x; else throw Bad_X(x); }
public:
  X(int x) { validate(x); } X() { validate(42); }
  X(string s) { int x = to<int>(s); validate(x); } 
  // ...
};
``` 
```c++
class X {
  int a;
public:
  X(int x) { if (0<x && x<=max) a=x; else throw Bad_X(x); }
  X() :X{42} { } X(string s) :X{to<int>(s)} { }
  // ...
};
```
- If you want two constructors to do the same action, verbosity hinders readability and repetition is error-prone.
- An constructor using a member-style initializer calls another constructor, which is called *delegating constructor* or *forwarding constructor*.
```c++
class X {
  int a;
public:
  X(int x) { if (0<x && x<=max) a=x; else throw Bad_X(x); }
  X() :X{42}, a{56} { } // error
  // ...
};
```
```c++
class X {
  int a;
public:
  X(int x) { if (0<x && x<=max) a=x; else throw Bad_X(x); }
  X() { X{42}; } // likely error
  // ...
};
```
- You cannot both delegate and explicitly initialize a member.
- Delegating is very different from explicitly calling a constructor in the body of a constructor.
  - `X{42}` simply creates a new unnamed object (a temporary) and does nothing with it.
***
- In-Class Initializers
  - If all you need is to set a member to a default value, in-Class initializers may be simpler.
  - We can specify an initializer for a non-static data member **in the class declaration**.
  ```c++
  class A {
  public:
    int a {7};
    int b = 77;
    // A() : a{7}, b{77} {}
  };
  ```
  - The `{}` and `=` initializer notations can be used for in-class member initializers, but the `()` notation cannot.
  ```c++
  class A {
  public:
    A() :a{7}, b{5}, algorithm{"MD5"}, state{"Constructor run"} {}
    A(int a_val) :a{a_val}, b{5}, algorithm{"MD5"}, state{"Constructor run"} {}
    A(D d) :a{7}, b{g(d)}, algorithm{"MD5"}, state{"Constructor run"} {}
    // ...
  private:
    int a, b;
    HashFunction algorithm; // cryptographic hash to be applied to all As
    string state; // string indicating state in object life cycle
  };
  ``` 
  ```c++
  class A {
  public:
    A() :a{7}, b{5} {}
    A(int a_val) :a{a_val}, b{5} {}
    A(D d) :a{7}, b{g(d)} {}
    // ...
  private:
    int a, b;
    HashFunction algorithm {"MD5"}; // cryptographic hash to be applied to all As
    string state {"Constructor run"}; // string indicating state in object life cycle
  }
  ```
  ```c++
  class A {
  public:
    A() {}
    A(int a_val) :a{a_val} {}
    A(D d) :b{g(d)} {}
    // ...
  private:
    int a {7};
    int b {5};
    HashFunction algorithm {"MD5"};
    string state {"Constructor run"};
  };
  ```
  - The real benefits come in more complicated classes with multiple constructors.
  - If a member is initialized by both an in-class initializer and a constructor, **only the constructor’s initialization is done**.
  ```c++
  int count = 0;
  int count2 = 0;

  int f(int i) { return i+count; }

  struct S {
    int m1 {count2}; // that is, ::count2 
    int m2 {f(m1)}; // that is, this->m1+::count; that is, ::count2+::count
    S() { ++count2; }  // very odd constructor
  };

  int main()
  {
    S s1; // {0,0}
    ++count;
    S s2;
  }
  ``` 
  - Member initialization is done in declaration order.
  - It is a bad idea to hide subtle dependencies on global data in member initializers.
***
- `static` Member Initialization
  ```c++
  class Node {
    // ...
    static int node_count; // declaration
  };

  int Node::node_count = 0; // definition
  ```
  - A `static` class member is **statically allocated** rather than part of each object of the class.
  ```c++
  class Curious {
  public:
    static const int c1 = 7; // OK const)
    static int c2 = 11; // error : not const
    const int c3 = 13;  // OK, but not static (§17.4.4)
    static const int c4 = sqrt(9);  // error : in-class initializer not constant
    static const ﬂoat c5 = 7.0;  // error : in-class not integral (use constexpr rather than 
    // ...
  };
  ```
  - For a few simple special cases, it is possible to initialize a `static` member **in the class declaration.**
    1. The `static` member must be a `const` of an integral or enumeration type, or a `constexpr` of a literal type.
    2. The initializer must be a *constant-expression*.
  - The main use of member constants is to **provide symbolic names** for constants needed elsewhere.

## Copy and Move
- Constructors, destructors, and copy and move operations for a type are not logically separate.
- When we need to transfer a value from a to b
  - Copy is the conventional meaning of `x=y`.
  - Move leaves `x` with `y`’s former value and y with some *moved-from state*. For the most cases that moved-from state is ‘‘empty.’’
- When you write a **move** operation, you should **leave the source object in a valid but unspecified state** because it will eventually be destroyed by its destructor.
- To save us from tedious repetitive work, copy and move have **default definitions**.
- There are five situations in which an object is copied or moved:
  - As the source of an assignment
  - As an object initializer
  - As a function argument
  - As a function return value
  - As an exception
***
- Copy
  - Copy for a class `X` is defined by two operations:
    - Copy constructor: `X(const X&)`
    - Copy assignment: `X& operator=(const X&)`
  - A copy constructor is supposed to make a copy of an object without modifying it.
  - When writing a copy operation, be sure to copy every base and member.
    - when someone adds a member to a class, it is easy to forget to add it to the list of members to be copied.
    - This is one reason to prefer the default (compiler-generated) copy operations.
  - Copy operation must meet two criteria:
    1. *Equivalence*: After `x=y`, operations on `x` and y should give the same result.
       - It is not uncommon for an object to contain members that are not considered part of its value. For example, a copy of a standard container does not copy its allocator.
       - Such ‘‘non-value’’ parts of an object’s state should not affect the result of comparison operators.
    2. *Independence*: After `x=y`, operations on `x` should not implicitly change the state of `y`.
       - Most of the problems related to independence have to do with objects that contain pointers. This is sometimes called *shallow copy* and often praised for ‘‘efﬁciency.’’
       - The obvious alternative of copying the complete state of an object is called **deep copy**.
       - A shallow copy leaves two objects (here, x and y) with a *shared* state, which is called *entanglement*.
  ```c++
  template<class T>
  class Matrix {
    array<int,2> dim; // two dimensions
    T∗ elem; // pointer to dim[0]*dim[1] elements of type T
  public:
    Matrix(int d1, int d2) :dim{d1,d2}, elem{new T[d1∗d2]} {} // simpliﬁed (no error handling)
    int size() const { return dim[0]∗dim[1]; }

    Matrix(const Matrix&); // copy constructor Matrix&
    operator=(const Matrix&); // copy assignment

    Matrix(Matrix&&); // move constructor
    Matrix& operator=(Matrix&&);  // move assignment

    ~Matrix() { delete[] elem; }
    // ...
  };

  template<class T> 
  Matrix:: Matrix(const Matrix& m) // copy constructor
    : dim{m.dim},
      elem{new T[m.size()]}
  {
    uninitialized_copy(m.elem,m.elem+m.size(),elem); // copy elements
  }

  template<class T>
  Matrix& Matrix::operator=(const Matrix& m) // copy assignment
  {
    if (dim[0]!=m.dim[0] || dim[1]!=m.dim[1])
      throw runtime_error("bad size in Matrix =");

    copy(m.elem,m.elem+m.size(),elem); // copy elements
  }
  ```
  - The default copy would be disastrously wrong
    - The `Matrix` copy would have a pointer to the same elements as the source.
    - The `Matrix` destructor would delete the (shared) elements twice
  - A copy constructor and a copy assignment differ in that
    - a copy **constructor initializes uninitialized** memory
    - the copy **assignment** operator must correctly deal with an **object that has already been constructed and may own resources**.
  - If a copy constructor cannot copy an element, it can throw an exception and leave with a mixture of its old value and the new.
  ```c++
  Matrix& Matrix::operator=(const Matrix& m) // copy assignment
  {
    Matrix tmp {m}; // make a copy
    swap(tmp,∗this); // swap tmp’s representation with *this’s
    return ∗this;
  }
  ```
  - If a mixture of its old value and the new is not considered acceptable, we can avoid it by the fundamental technique of ﬁrst making a copy and then swapping.
  ```c++
  struct B1 {
    B1();
    B1(const B1&);
    // ...
  };

  struct B2 {
    B2(int);
    B2(const B2&);
    // ...
  };

  struct D : B1, B2 {
    D(int i) :B1{}, B2{i}, m1{}, m2{2∗i} {}
    D(const D& a) :B1{a}, B2{a}, m1{a.m1}, m2{a.m2} {}
    B1 m1; 
    B2 m2;
  };

  D d {1}; // construct with int argument
  D dd {d}; // copy construct
  ``` 
  - For the purposes of copying, **a base is just a member**: to copy an object of a derived class **you have to copy its bases**.
  - A `virtual` base may appear as a base of several classes in a hierarchy. A default copy constructor will correctly copy it.
***
- Copy-on-write
  - The idea is that a copy doesn’t actually need independence until a shared state is written to.
  - We can delay the copying of the shared state until just before the ﬁrst write to it.
  ```c++
  class Image {
  public:
    // ...
    Image(const Image& a); // copy constructor
    // ...
    void write_block(Descriptor);
    // ...
  private:
    Representation∗ clone(); // copy *rep
    Representation∗ rep;
    bool shared;
  };

  Image::Image(const Image& a)
    :rep{a.rep},
    shared{true}
  {
  }

  void write_block(Descriptor d)
  {
    if (shared) {
      rep = clone(); // make a copy of *rep
      shared = false; // no more sharing
    }
    
    // ... now we can safely write to our own copy of rep ...
  }
  ``` 
  - Assume that a Representation can be huge and that a write_block() is expensive
    - It can make sense to implement the copy constructor as a shallow copy.
    - We protect the argument to that copy constructor by **copying the Representation before a write**.
***
- **Slicing**
  ```c++
  struct Base {
    int b;
    Base(const Base&);
    // ...
  };

  struct Derived : Base {
    int d;
    Derived(const Derived&);
    // ...
  };

  void naive(Base∗ p)
  {
    B b2 = ∗p; // may slice: invokes Base::Base(const Base&)
    // ...
  }

  void user()
  {
    Derived d;
    naive(&d);
    Base bb = d; // slices: invokes Base::Base(const Base&), not Derived::Derived(const Derived&)
    // ...
  } 
  ```
  - A pointer to a derived class implicitly converts to a pointer to its public base class.
  - The variables b2 and bb contain copies of the Base part of d, that is, a copy of d.b. The member d.d is not copied. This phenomenon is called *slicing*.
  - If you don’t want slicing, you have two major tools to prevent it:
    1. Prohibit copying of the base class: `delete` the copy operations
    2. Prevent conversion of a pointer to a derived to a pointer to a base: make the base class a `private` or `protected` base.
***
- Move
  - C++ directly supports the notion of moving. In particular, we can deﬁne move constructors and move assignments to move rather than copy their argument.
  - Move operations typically **do not throw exceptions**; they don’t acquire resources or do complicated operations,
  ```C++
  template<class T>
  void swap(T& a, T& b)
  {
    const T tmp = a; // put a copy of a into tmp 
    a = b; // put a copy of b into a 
    b = tmp; // put a copy of tmp into b
  };

  void f(string& s1, string& s2,
    vector<string>& vs1, vector<string>& vs2,
    Matrix& m1, Matrix& m2
  {
    swap(s1,s2);
    swap(vs1.vs2);
    swap(m1,m2);
  }
  ```
  - The traditional way of getting a value from a to b is to copy it.
  - After the initialization of `tmp`, we have two copies of `a`’s value.
  - **The cost of copying could be signiﬁcant**.
  - The fundamental problem is that we really didn’t want to do any copying at all: we just wanted to exchange pairs of values.
  ```c++
  template<class T>
  class Matrix {
    array<int,2> dim; // two dimensions
    T∗ elem; // pointer to dim[0]*dim[1] elements of type T
  public:
    Matrix(int d1, int d2) :dim{d1,d2}, elem{new T[d1∗d2]} {} // simpliﬁed (no error handling)
    int size() const { return dim[0]∗dim[1]; }

    Matrix(const Matrix&); // copy constructor Matrix&
    operator=(const Matrix&); // copy assignment

    Matrix(Matrix&&); // move constructor
    Matrix& operator=(Matrix&&);  // move assignment

    ~Matrix() { delete[] elem; }
    // ...
  };

  template<class T>
  Matrix<T>::Matrix(Matrix&& a) // move constructor
    :dim{a.dim}, elem{a.elem}  // grab a’s representation
  {
    a.dim = {0,0}; // clear a’s representation
    a.elem = nullptr;
  }

  template<class T>
  Matrix<T>& Matrix<T>::operator=(Matrix&& a) // move assignment
  {
    swap(dim,a.dim); // swap representations
    swap(elem,a.elem);
    return ∗this;
  }
  ```
  - `&&` indicates an rvalue reference
  - move assignment and move constructors take rvalues.
    - For a `return` value, the move constructor is chosen.
  - We can deﬁne `Matrix`’s move constructor to simply take the representation from its source and replace it with an empty `Matrix`.
  - For the move assignment, we can simply do a swap.
  - The source is just about to be destroyed, so we can just let the destructor for the source do the necessary cleanup work for us.
  ```c++
  template<class T>
  void swap(T& a, T& b) // "perfect swap" (almost)
  {
    T tmp = std::move(a);
    a = std::move(b);
    b = std::move(tmp);
  }
  ``` 
  - How does the compiler know when it can use a move operation rather than a copy operation
    1. A return value
    2. Giving an rvalue reference argument
  - **The `move()` is a standard-library function returning an rvalue reference to its argument**.
    - `std::move(x)` does not move anything
    - It would have been better if `move()` had been called `rval()`, but the name has been used for this operation for years.

## Generating Default Operations
- By default, a class provides:
  - A default constructor: `X()`
  - A copy constructor: `X(const X&)`
  - A copy assignment: `X& operator=(const X&)`
  - A move constructor: `X(X&&)`
  - A move assignment: `X& operator=(X&&)`
  - A destructor: `~X()`
- If the programmer takes control by deﬁning one or more of those operations
  - If the programmer declares any constructor for a class, the default constructor is not generated for that class. (**Default constructor**)
  - If the programmer declares a copy operation, a move operation, or a destructor for a class, no copy operation, move operation, or destructor is generated for that class. (**Default operations**)
- For every class, we should ask:
  - Is a default constructor needed?
  - Is a destructor needed?
  - Are copy operations needed?
  - Are move operations needed?
- The value of a moved-from object of a **built-in type is unchanged**.
- Default constructor default constructs each member.
  - "Default initialization" of a built-in member leaves that member uninitialized
```c++
class gslice {
  valarray<size_t> size;
  valarray<size_t> stride;
  valarray<size_t> d1;
public:
  gslice() = default;
  ˜gslice() = default;
  gslice(const gslice&) = default;
  gslice(gslice&&) = default;
  gslice& operator=(const gslice&) = default;
  gslice& operator=(gslice&&) = default;
  // ...
};
```
```c++
class gslice {
  valarray<size_t> size;
  valarray<size_t> stride;
  valarray<size_t> d1;
public:
  // ...
};
```
- If necessary, we can be explicit about which functions are generated and which are not
- The former is used by less experienced C++ programmers: what you don’t see, you might forget about.
- Using `=default` is always better than writing **your own default semantics**.
```c++
template<class T>
class Handle {
  T∗ p;
public:
  Handle(T∗ pp) :p{pp} { }
  T& operator∗() { return ∗p; }
  ˜Handle() { delete p; }
};

void f3()
{
  Handle<int> h1 {new int{7}};
  Handle<int> h2 {h1};  // error : no copy constructor
  // ...
}
```
- Had `Handle` had a default copy constructor, both `h1` and `h2` would have had a copy of the pointer and both would have deleted it.
- If that pointer member does not represent ownership and memberwise copy is appropriate, explicit `=default` and a comment are most likely a good idea.
- `Handle` declares a destructor: this suppresses the generation of copy and move operations.
  - **The generation of copy operations is only deprecated, not banned**.
  - If you ignore warnings, you might get this example past the compiler.
```c++
class Base {
  // ...
  Base& operator=(const Base&) = delete;// disallow copying
  Base(const Base&) = delete;

  Base& operator=(Base&&) = delete;
  Base(Base&&) = delete;
}

Base x1;
Base x2 {x1}; // error: no copy constructor
```
- We can state that a function does not exist so that it is an error to try to use it.
- The most obvious use is to eliminate otherwise defaulted functions.
  - It is common to want to **prevent the copying of classes used as bases** because such copying easily leads to slicing
```c++
template<class T>
T∗ clone(T∗ p) // return copy of *p
{
  return new T{∗p}; 
};

Foo∗ clone(Foo∗) = delete; // don’t try to clone a Foo

void f(Shape∗ ps, Foo∗ pf)
{
  Shape∗ ps2 = clone(ps); // ﬁne
  Foo∗ pf2 = clone(pf); // error : clone(Foo*) deleted
}
``` 
- We can eliminate a specialization from the set of possible specializations of a function template.
```c++
struct Z {
  // ...
  Z(double);
  Z(int) = delete; 
};

void f()
{
  Z z1 {1};
  Z z2 {1.0}; 
}
```
- Another application is to eliminate an undesired conversion.
```c++
class Not_on_stack {
  // ...
  ˜Not_on_stack() = delete; 
};

class Not_on_free_store {
  // ...
  void∗ operator new(size_t) = delete;
};

void f()
{
  Not_on_stack v1; // error : can’t destroy
  Not_on_free_store v2; // OK

  Not_on_stack∗ p1 = new Not_on_stack; // OK 
  Not_on_free_store∗ p2 = new Not_on_free_store;  // error : can’t allocate
}
``` 
- You can’t have a local variable that can’t be destroyed. we can never delete that Not_on_stack object.
- Difference between a `=deleted` function and one that simply has not been declared:
  - The compiler notes that the programmer has tried to use the deleted function and gives an error.
  - In the latter case, the compiler looks for alternatives, such as not invoking a destructor or using a global operator `new()`.
