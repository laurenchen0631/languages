## Operators
- Logical Operators
  - The logical operators take operands of arithmetic and pointer types, convert them to `bool`.
  - `&&` and `||`
    - `while (p && !whitespace(*p)) ++p;` 
    - They evaluate their second argument only if necessary, so they can be used to control evaluation order.
  - `!`: not
***
- Bitwise Logical Operators
  - Includes
    - `&` and
    - `|` or
    - `ˆ`: exclusive or, xor
    - `~`: complement
    - `>>`: right shift
    - `<<`: left shift
  - They  are applied to objects of integral types.
  ```C++
  enum ios_base::iostate {
    goodbit=0, eofbit=1, failbit=2, badbit=4
  };

  state = goodbit; // ...

  if (state&(badbit|failbit)) // stream not good

  state |= eofbit;
  ``` 
  - A typical use of bitwise logical operators is to implement the notion of a small set.
  - An enumeration can be used to name the members of such a set.
  - The number of bits limits the number of members.
  - The `|=` operator is used to add to the state.
  - Convenient bit manipulation can be very important, but for reliability, maintainability, portability, etc., it should be kept at low levels of a system.
  ```C++
  constexpr unsigned short middle(int a) {
    static_assert(sizeof(int)==4,"unexpected int size");
    static_assert(sizeof(short)==2,"unexpected short size");
    
    return (a>>8)&0xFFFF;
  }

  int x = 0xFF00FF00; // assume sizeof(int)==4
  short y = middle(x); // y = 0x00FF
  ```
  - The function extracts the middle 16 bits of a 32-bit int.
***
- Conditional Expressions
  ```C++
  max = (a<=b) ? b : a;
  ```
  - `if`-`else`-statements can conveniently be replaced by conditional-expressions.
  - The parentheses around the condition are not necessary,
  - **Either `a` must be implicitly convertible to `b`’s type or vice versa.**
  ```C++
  void fct(int* p)
  {
    int i = (p) ? *p : std::runtime_error{"unexpected nullptr}; // ...
  }
  ``` 
  - one branch may be a throw-expression (
***
- Increment and Decrement
  - Provided `lvalue` has no side effects, `++lvalue` means `lvalue+=1`, which again means `lvalue=lvalue+1`.
  - The value of `x++` is the old value of `x`. For example, `y=x++` is equivalent to `y=(t=x,x=x+1,t)`.
  ```C++
  void cpy(char* p, const char* q)
  {
    while (*p++ = *q++);
  }

  void cpy1(char* p, const char* q)
  {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; q[i]!=0 ; i++)
      p[i] = q[i];
    p[i] = 0;
  }

  void cpy2(char* p, const char* q)
  {
    while (*q != 0) {
      *p = *q;
      p++; 
      q++;
    }
    *p = 0;
  }
  ``` 
  - The style of coding is not uncommon.
  - The value of `*p++ = *q++` is `*q`.
  - We don’t notice that `*q` is zero until we already have copied it into `*p` and incremented `p`. Consequently, we can eliminate the final assignment of the terminating zero.
  - The most efficient way of copying a zero-terminated character string is typically the standard C-style string copy function: `char* strcpy(char*, const char*);`
  - **Whenever possible, use standard-library facilities in preference to fiddling with pointers and bytes.**

## Free Store
- A named object has its lifetime determined by its scope.
- It is often useful to create an object that exists independently of the scope.
- C++ implementation does not guarantee the presence of a "garbage collector" that looks out for unreferenced objects.
- Objects **allocated by `new`** are said to be "on the free store" (also, "on the heap" or "in dynamic memory").
- Trying the `=` notation for initializing an object created using new results in an *error*: `int* p = new int = 7;`
```C++
auto pc = new complex<double>; // the complex is initialized to {0,0}
auto pi = new int;  // the int is uninitialized

auto pc = new complex<double>{}; // the complex is initialized to {0,0}
auto pi = new int{}; // the int is initialized to 0
``` 
- If a type has a **default constructor**, we can leave out the initializer, but **built-in types are by default uninitialized**.
- To be sure to get default initialization, use `{}`.
```C++
struct Enode {
  Token_value oper;
  Enode* left;
  Enode* right;
  // ...
};


Enode* expr(bool get)
{
  Enode* left = term(get);

  for (;;) {
    switch (ts.current().kind) {
    case Kind::plus:
    case Kind::minus:
      left = new Enode {ts.current().kind,left,term(true)};
      break;
    default:
      return left; // return node
    }
  }
}

void generate(Enode* n)
{
  switch (n−>oper) {
  case Kind::plus:
    // use n
    delete n; // delete an Enode from the free store 
  }
}
``` 
- The resulting pointer is assigned to left and eventually returned from `expr()`.
- An object created by new exists until it is explicitly destroyed by `delete`.
- Applying `delete` to the `nullptr` has no effect.
***
- **Memory Management**
  - It is genuinely hard to consistently deallocate every allocated object in a large program.
  - Recommend two general approaches to resource management
    1. Prefer scoped variables.
    2. RAII: Place its pointer into a *manager object* (*handler*): string, vector (STL), `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, **move semantics** to return large objects from functions.
        ```C++
        // we simply move the ss out of reverse() rather than copying any elements
        string reverse(const string& s) {
          string ss;
          for (int i=s.size()−1; 0<=i; −−i)
            ss.push_back(s[i]);
          return ss;
        }
        ```
  - **Rule of thumb**: `new` belongs in constructors and similar operations, `delete` belongs in destructor. "no naked `new`s"
  - The main problems with free store are:
    - *Leaked objects*: People use `new` and then forget to `delete` the allocated object.
    - *Premature deletion*: People `delete` an object that they have some other pointer to.
    - *Double deletion*: An object is deleted twice, invoking its destructor (if any) twice.
  - Leaked object
    ```C++
    void f1()
    {
      X* p =new X;
      // ... use *p ...
      delete p;
    }
    ```
    - Do not use `new` to create local objects. 
    - a `return` or an exception thrown before the `delete` will cause a memory leak
  - Premature deletion
    ```C++
    int* p1 = new int{99}; 
    int* p2 = p1; // potential trouble
    delete p1;  // now p2 doesn’t point to a valid object
    p1 = nullptr; // gives a false sense of safety
    char* p3 = new char{'x'};  // p3 may now point to the memory pointed to by p2
    *p2 = 999;  // this may cause trouble
    cout << *p3 << '\n';  // may not print x
    ``` 
    - It may indeed point to memory that has been reused for another object
  - Double deletion
    ```c++
    void sloppy() // very bad code
    {
      int* p = new int[1000]; // acquire memory
      // ... use *p ...
      delete[] p; // release memory
      // ... wait a while ...
      delete[] p; // but sloppy() does not own *p
    }
    ``` 
    - Resource managers typically cannot track what code owns a resource.
    - By the second `delete[]`, the memory pointed to by `*p` may have been reallocated for some other use and the allocator may get corrupted.
    - In general, a double deletion is undeﬁned behavior and the results are unpredictable and usually disastrous.
- Arrays
  ```C++
  char* save_string(const char* p)
  {
    char* s = new char[strlen(p)+1];
    strcpy(s,p); // copy from p to s
    return s;
  }

  char* save_string2(const char* p)
  {
    return string{p};
  }

  int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) exit(1);
    char* p = save_string(argv[1]);
    // ...
    delete[] p;
  }
  ```
  - **Arrays of objects can also be created using `new`.**
  - `delete[]` is used to delete arrays.
  - the standard-library `string` can be used to simplify the save_string():
  - An object allocated needs space to hold the object’s size.
    - Most modern machines use 8-byte words.
    - This overhead is not signiﬁcant when we allocate many objects or large objects, but it can **matter if we allocate lots of small object**.
  - Applying `delete[]` to the null pointer has no effect.
***
- Memory Space
  ```C++
  void∗ operator new(size_t); // allocate space for individual object 
  void operator delete(void∗ p); // if (p) deallocate space allocated using operator new()

  void∗ operator new[](size_t); // allocate space for array
  void operator delete[](void∗ p); // if (p) deallocate space allocated using operator new[]()
  ```
  - `new`, `delete`, `new[]`, and `delete[]` are implemented using functions presented in the `<new>` header
  - The allocation and deallocation functions deal in untyped and uninitialized memory.
  - The operators new and delete handle the **mapping between this untyped-memory layer and the typed-object layer**.
  ```C++
  void f()
  {
    vector<char∗> v;

    try {
      for (;;) {
        char ∗ p = new char[10000]; // acquire some memory 
        v.push_back(p); // make sure the new memory is referenced 
        p[0] = 'x'; // use the new memory
      }
    }
    catch(bad_alloc) {
      cerr << "Memory exhausted!\n";
    }
    
  }
  ``` 
  - If `new` cannot find store to allocate, the allocator throws a standard-library `bad_alloc` exception.
  - The `new` operator is **not guaranteed to throw** when you run out of physical main memory.
- Overloading `new`
