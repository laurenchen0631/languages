## Operators
- Logical Operators
  - The logical operators take operands of arithmetic and pointer types, convert them to `bool`.
  - `&&` and `||`
    - `while (p && !whitespace(*p)) ++p;` 
    - They evaluate their second argument only if necessary, so they can be used to control evaluation order.
  - `!`: not
***
- Bitwise Logical Operators
  - Includes
    - `&` and
    - `|` or
    - `ˆ`: exclusive or, xor
    - `~`: complement
    - `>>`: right shift
    - `<<`: left shift
  - They  are applied to objects of integral types.
  ```C++
  enum ios_base::iostate {
    goodbit=0, eofbit=1, failbit=2, badbit=4
  };

  state = goodbit; // ...

  if (state&(badbit|failbit)) // stream not good

  state |= eofbit;
  ``` 
  - A typical use of bitwise logical operators is to implement the notion of a small set.
  - An enumeration can be used to name the members of such a set.
  - The number of bits limits the number of members.
  - The `|=` operator is used to add to the state.
  - Convenient bit manipulation can be very important, but for reliability, maintainability, portability, etc., it should be kept at low levels of a system.
  ```C++
  constexpr unsigned short middle(int a) {
    static_assert(sizeof(int)==4,"unexpected int size");
    static_assert(sizeof(short)==2,"unexpected short size");
    
    return (a>>8)&0xFFFF;
  }

  int x = 0xFF00FF00; // assume sizeof(int)==4
  short y = middle(x); // y = 0x00FF
  ```
  - The function extracts the middle 16 bits of a 32-bit int.
***
- Conditional Expressions
  ```C++
  max = (a<=b) ? b : a;
  ```
  - `if`-`else`-statements can conveniently be replaced by conditional-expressions.
  - The parentheses around the condition are not necessary,
  - **Either `a` must be implicitly convertible to `b`’s type or vice versa.**
  ```C++
  void fct(int* p)
  {
    int i = (p) ? *p : std::runtime_error{"unexpected nullptr}; // ...
  }
  ``` 
  - one branch may be a throw-expression (
***
- Increment and Decrement
  - Provided `lvalue` has no side effects, `++lvalue` means `lvalue+=1`, which again means `lvalue=lvalue+1`.
  - The value of `x++` is the old value of `x`. For example, `y=x++` is equivalent to `y=(t=x,x=x+1,t)`.
  ```C++
  void cpy(char* p, const char* q)
  {
    while (*p++ = *q++);
  }

  void cpy1(char* p, const char* q)
  {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; q[i]!=0 ; i++)
      p[i] = q[i];
    p[i] = 0;
  }

  void cpy2(char* p, const char* q)
  {
    while (*q != 0) {
      *p = *q;
      p++; 
      q++;
    }
    *p = 0;
  }
  ``` 
  - The style of coding is not uncommon.
  - The value of `*p++ = *q++` is `*q`.
  - We don’t notice that `*q` is zero until we already have copied it into `*p` and incremented `p`. Consequently, we can eliminate the final assignment of the terminating zero.
  - The most efficient way of copying a zero-terminated character string is typically the standard C-style string copy function: `char* strcpy(char*, const char*);`
  - **Whenever possible, use standard-library facilities in preference to fiddling with pointers and bytes.**

## Free Store
- A named object has its lifetime determined by its scope.
- It is often useful to create an object that exists independently of the scope.
- C++ implementation does not guarantee the presence of a "garbage collector" that looks out for unreferenced objects.
- Objects **allocated by `new`** are said to be "on the free store" (also, "on the heap" or "in dynamic memory").
- Trying the `=` notation for initializing an object created using new results in an *error*: `int* p = new int = 7;`
```C++
auto pc = new complex<double>; // the complex is initialized to {0,0}
auto pi = new int;  // the int is uninitialized

auto pc = new complex<double>{}; // the complex is initialized to {0,0}
auto pi = new int{}; // the int is initialized to 0
``` 
- If a type has a **default constructor**, we can leave out the initializer, but **built-in types are by default uninitialized**.
- To be sure to get default initialization, use `{}`.
```C++
struct Enode {
  Token_value oper;
  Enode* left;
  Enode* right;
  // ...
};


Enode* expr(bool get)
{
  Enode* left = term(get);

  for (;;) {
    switch (ts.current().kind) {
    case Kind::plus:
    case Kind::minus:
      left = new Enode {ts.current().kind,left,term(true)};
      break;
    default:
      return left; // return node
    }
  }
}

void generate(Enode* n)
{
  switch (n−>oper) {
  case Kind::plus:
    // use n
    delete n; // delete an Enode from the free store 
  }
}
``` 
- The resulting pointer is assigned to left and eventually returned from `expr()`.
- An object created by new exists until it is explicitly destroyed by `delete`.
- Applying `delete` to the `nullptr` has no effect.
***
- **Memory Management**
  - It is genuinely hard to consistently deallocate every allocated object in a large program.
  - Recommend two general approaches to resource management
    1. Prefer scoped variables.
    2. RAII: Place its pointer into a *manager object* (*handler*): string, vector (STL), `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, **move semantics** to return large objects from functions.
        ```C++
        // we simply move the ss out of reverse() rather than copying any elements
        string reverse(const string& s) {
          string ss;
          for (int i=s.size()−1; 0<=i; −−i)
            ss.push_back(s[i]);
          return ss;
        }
        ```
  - **Rule of thumb**: `new` belongs in constructors and similar operations, `delete` belongs in destructor. "no naked `new`s"
  - The main problems with free store are:
    - *Leaked objects*: People use `new` and then forget to `delete` the allocated object.
    - *Premature deletion*: People `delete` an object that they have some other pointer to.
    - *Double deletion*: An object is deleted twice, invoking its destructor (if any) twice.
  - Leaked object
    ```C++
    void f1()
    {
      X* p =new X;
      // ... use *p ...
      delete p;
    }
    ```
    - Do not use `new` to create local objects. 
    - a `return` or an exception thrown before the `delete` will cause a memory leak
  - Premature deletion
    ```C++
    int* p1 = new int{99}; 
    int* p2 = p1; // potential trouble
    delete p1;  // now p2 doesn’t point to a valid object
    p1 = nullptr; // gives a false sense of safety
    char* p3 = new char{'x'};  // p3 may now point to the memory pointed to by p2
    *p2 = 999;  // this may cause trouble
    cout << *p3 << '\n';  // may not print x
    ``` 
    - It may indeed point to memory that has been reused for another object
  - Double deletion
    ```c++
    void sloppy() // very bad code
    {
      int* p = new int[1000]; // acquire memory
      // ... use *p ...
      delete[] p; // release memory
      // ... wait a while ...
      delete[] p; // but sloppy() does not own *p
    }
    ``` 
    - Resource managers typically cannot track what code owns a resource.
    - By the second `delete[]`, the memory pointed to by `*p` may have been reallocated for some other use and the allocator may get corrupted.
    - In general, a double deletion is undefined behavior and the results are unpredictable and usually disastrous.
- Arrays
  ```C++
  char* save_string(const char* p)
  {
    char* s = new char[strlen(p)+1];
    strcpy(s,p); // copy from p to s
    return s;
  }

  char* save_string2(const char* p)
  {
    return string{p};
  }

  int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) exit(1);
    char* p = save_string(argv[1]);
    // ...
    delete[] p;
  }
  ```
  - **Arrays of objects can also be created using `new`.**
  - `delete[]` is used to delete arrays.
  - the standard-library `string` can be used to simplify the save_string():
  - An object allocated needs space to hold the object’s size.
    - Most modern machines use 8-byte words.
    - This overhead is not significant when we allocate many objects or large objects, but it can **matter if we allocate lots of small object**.
  - Applying `delete[]` to the null pointer has no effect.
***
- Memory Space
  ```C++
  void* operator new(size_t); // allocate space for individual object 
  void operator delete(void* p); // if (p) deallocate space allocated using operator new()

  void* operator new[](size_t); // allocate space for array
  void operator delete[](void* p); // if (p) deallocate space allocated using operator new[]()
  ```
  - `new`, `delete`, `new[]`, and `delete[]` are implemented using functions presented in the `<new>` header
  - The allocation and deallocation functions deal in untyped and uninitialized memory.
  - The operators new and delete handle the **mapping between this untyped-memory layer and the typed-object layer**.
  ```C++
  void f()
  {
    vector<char*> v;

    try {
      for (;;) {
        char * p = new char[10000]; // acquire some memory 
        v.push_back(p); // make sure the new memory is referenced 
        p[0] = 'x'; // use the new memory
      }
    }
    catch(bad_alloc) {
      cerr << "Memory exhausted!\n";
    }
    
  }
  ``` 
  - If `new` cannot find store to allocate, the allocator throws a standard-library `bad_alloc` exception.
  - The `new` operator is **not guaranteed to throw** when you run out of physical main memory.
- Overloading `new`
  - We can place objects anywhere by providing an allocator function with extra arguments and then supplying such extra arguments when using `new`
  ```C++
  void* operator new (size_t sz, void* p) noexcept; // place object of size sz at p 
  void* operator new[](size_t sz, void* p) noexcept; // place object of size sz at p

  void operator delete (void* p, void*) noexcept; // if (p) make *p invalid 
  void operator delete[](void* p, void*) noexcept; // if (p) make *p invalid

  void* buf = reinterpret_cast<void*>(0xF00F);
  X* p2 = new(buf) X;
  ``` 
  - `new(buf) X` syntax is known as the *placement syntax*.
  - Every operator `new()` has a `size_t` as its first argument.
  ```C++
  class Arena {
  public:
    virtual void* alloc(size_t) =0;
    virtual void free(void*) =0;
    // ...
  };

  void* operator new(size_t sz, Arena* a)
  {
    return a−>alloc(sz);
  }

  extern Arena* Persistent;
  extern Arena* Shared;

  void g(int i)
  {
    X* p = new(Persistent) X(i); // X in persistent storage 
    X* q = new(Shared) X(i); // X in shared memory
    // ...
  }

  void destroy(X* p, Arena* a)
  {
    p−>˜X(); // call destructor
    a−>free(p); // free memory
  }
  ``` 
  - Placing an object in an area that is not (directly) controlled by the standard free-store manager implies that some care is required when destroying the object.
  - Explicit calls of destructors should be avoided except in the implementation of resource management classes.
  ```c++ 
  void f(int n)
  {
    int* p = new(nothrow) int[n]; // allocate n ints on the free store
    if (p==nullptr) { // no memory available
      // ... handle allocation error ...
    }
    // ...
    operator delete(nothrow, p); // deallocate *p
  }
  ```
  - That `nothrow` is the name of an object of the standard-library type `nothrow_t` declared in `<new>`.
  - These operator new functions return nullptr, rather than throwing bad_alloc.

## List
- `{}`-lists can appear in two forms
  1. Qualified by a type, `T{...}`, meaning "create an object of type `T` initialized by `T{...}`"
  2. Unqualified `{...}`, for which the the type must be determined from the context of use.
```c++
struct S { int a, b; };
struct SS { double a, b; };

void f(S); // f() takes an S

void g(S);
void g(SS); // g() is overloaded

void h()
{
  f({1,2}); // OK: call f(S{1,2})

  g({1,2}); // error: ambiguous
  g(S{1,2}); // OK: call g(S)
  g(SS{1,2}); // OK: call g(SS)
}
``` 
- Lists can have zero, one, or more elements.
- A `{}`-list is used to construct an object of some type, so the number of elements and their types must be what is required.
```c++
vector<double> v = {1, 2, 3.14};
``` 
```c++
const double temp[] = {double{1}, double{2}, 3.14 } ;
const initializer_list<double> tmp(temp,sizeof(temp)/sizeof(double));
vector<double> v(tmp);
```
- The standard-library vector has an initializer-list constructor, so the initializer list is interpreted as a temporary constructed
- An **`initializer_list` is a small object** (probably two words), so passing it by value makes sense.
```C++
void f()
{
  initializer_list<int> lst {1,2,3};
  cout << *lst.begin() << '\n';
  *lst.begin() = 2; // error : lst is immutable
  cout << *lst.begin() << '\n';
}
``` 
- Having a `{}`-list be immutable implies that a container taking elements from it must use a copy operation, rather than a move operation.
***
- Qualified Lists
  ```c++
  struct S { int a, b; };

  void f()
  {
    S v {7,8}; // direct initialization of a variable
    v = S{7,8}; // assign using qualified list
    S* p = new S{7,8}; // construct on free store using qualified list
  }
  ```
  - Qualified list are those of *direct initialization*.
  ```C++
  template<class T>
  T square(T x)
  {
    return x*x;
  }

  void f(int i)
  {
    double d = square(double{i});
    complex<double> z = square(complex<double>{i});
  }
  ``` 
  - One way of looking at a qualified initializer list with one element is as a **conversion from one type to another**.
- Unqualified Lists
  - A unqualified list is used where an expected type is unambiguously known
  - It can be used as an expression only as
    - A function argument
    - A return value
    - The right-hand operand of an assignment operator (=, +=, *=, etc.)
    - A subscript
  ```C++
  int f(double d, Matrix& m)
  {
    int v {7}; // initializer (direct initialization)
    int v2 = {7}; // assume m takes value pairs as subscripts
    int v3 = m[{2,3}]; // initializer (copy initialization) 

    v = {8};  // right-hand operand of assignment 
    v += {88};  // right-hand operand of assignment 
    {v} = 9; // error: not left-hand operand of assignment
    v = 7+{10}; // error: not an operand of a non-assignment operator 

    f({10.0}); // function argument 

    
    return {11} // return value
  ;
  ```
  - Unqualified list is not allowed on the left-hand side in C++.
  - When used as the initializer for **a named object without the use of a `=`**, an unqualified `{}`-list performs **direct initialization**. In all other cases, it performs copy initialization.
  ```C++
  auto x0 = {}; // error (no element type)
  auto x1 = {1};  // initializer_list<int>
  auto x2 = {1,2}; // initializer_list<int>

  auto x3 = {1,2,3}; // initializer_list<int>
  auto x4 = {1,2.0}; // error: nonhomogeneous list
  ``` 
  - The type of a `{}`-list can be deduced (only) if all elements are of the same type.
  - Beware zero elements can be a special case.
  ```C++
  template<typename T>
  void f(T);

  f({}); // error: type of initializer is unknown 
  f({1}); // error: an unqualified list does not match "plain T"
  f({1,2}); // error: an unqualified list does not match "plain T"
  f({1,2,3});  // error: an unqualified list does not match "plain T"
  ``` 
  - We do not deduce the type of an unqualified list for a plain template argument.
  - This is a language restriction, rather than a fundamental rule.
  - To deduce T the compiler would first have to decide that the user really wanted a vector. In general, that would require an instantiation of `vector`. It would be possible to handle that, but it could be costly in compile time.

## Lambda Expressions
- A *lambda expression* is also called a *lambda function* or a *lambda*.
- It is a simplified notation for defining and using an anonymous function object.
- In the context of gui, such operations are often referred to as *callbacks*.
- A lambda expression consists of a sequence of parts
  - *Capture list*: specifying what names from the definition environment can be used in the lambda expression’s body
  - Optional *parameter list*
  - Optional `mutable` specifier: indicate that the lambda expression’s body may modify the state of the lambda
  - Optional `noexcept` specifier
  - Optional return type declaration of the form `−>` type
  - A *body*
- A lambda can be used as "the body" for a generalized **loop/traversal construct** represented as an algorithm.
```c++
void print_modulo(const vector<int>& v, ostream& os, int m)
// output v[i] to os if v[i]%m==0
{
  for_each(begin(v),end(v),
    [&os,m](int x) { if (x%m==0) os << x << '\n'; }
  );
}
``` 
```c++
class Modulo_print {
  ostream& os; // members to hold the capture list
  int m;
public:
  Modulo_print(ostream& s, int mm) :os(s), m(mm) {}
  void operator()(int x) const { if (x%m==0) os << x << '\n'; }
};

void print_modulo(const vector<int>& v, ostream& os, int m)
// output v[i] to os if v[i]%m==0
{
  for_each(begin(v),end(v),Modulo_print{os,m});
}
```
- It's useful to understand the semantics of a lambda by considering it a shorthand for defining and using a *function object*
- `&` before os means that we should store a reference.
- Absence of a `&` for m means that we should store a copy.
- An object of a class generated from a lambda is called a *closure object*.
- If a lambda captures every local variable by reference, the closure may be optimized.
- `for_each` is a rather special algorithm, and `vector<int>` is a very specific container.
```C++
void print_modulo(const vector<int>& v, ostream& os, int m)
{
  auto Modulo_print = [&os,m] (int x) { if (x%m==0) os << x << '\n'; };
  for_each(begin(v),end(v),Modulo_print);
}
``` 
- If we really want a name, **we can just name the lambda**.
- Naming a lambda also simplifies code layout and **allows for recursion**.
***
- Capture
  ```C++
  void algo(vector<int>& v)
  {
    sort(v.begin(),v.end()); // sor t values
    // ...
    sort(v.begin(),v.end(),[](int x, int y) { return abs(x)<abs(y); });
    // ...
  }
  ```
  - Lambdas defined with the empty lambda introducer `[]` means it require no access to their local environment.
  - Lambda introducer `[]` can take various forms:
    - `[]`: an empty capture list.
    - `[&]`: implicitly capture by reference. All local variables are accessed by reference.
    - `[=]`: implicitly capture by value. All names refer to copies of the local variables.
    - `[`*capture-list*`]`: explicit capture. Variables with names preceded by & are captured by reference. Other variables are captured by value. A capture list can also **contain `this` and names followed by `...` as elements.**
    - `[&,`*capture-list*`]`: implicitly capture by reference all local variables with names not mentioned in the list.
    - `[=,`*capture-list*`]`: implicitly capture by value all local variables with names not mentioned in the list.
  - **Only capture by reference allows modification** of variables in the calling environment.
  ```c++
  void setup(Menu& m)
  {
    // ...
    Point p1, p2, p3; // compute positions of p1, p2, and p3
    m.add("draw triangle",[&]{ m.draw(p1,p2,p3); }); // probable disaster
    // ...
  }
  ```
  - **A lambda might outlive its caller**. This can happen if we pass a lambda to a **different thread** or if the callee **stores away the lambda for later** use.
  - When a lambda might outlive, capturing by value (`[=]`) is typically best.
  ```C++
  template<typename U, typename V>
  ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const pair<U,V>& p)
  {
    return os << '{' << p.first << ',' << p.second << '}';
  }

  void print_all(const map<string,int>& m, const string& label)
  {
    cout << label << ":\n{\n";
    for_each(m.begin(),m.end(),
      [](const pair<string,int>& p) { cout << p << '\n'; }
    );
    cout << "}\n";
  }
  ``` 
  - Here, we don’t need to capture `cout` or the output operator for pair.
  - **We don’t need to capture namespace** variables because they are always accessible.
  ```c++
  class Request {
    function<map<string,string>(const map<string,string>&)> oper;
    map<string,string> values; // arguments
    map<string,string> results; // targets
  public:
    Request(const string& s); // parse and store request
    void execute()
    {
      [this]() { results=oper(values); }  // do oper to values yielding results
    }
  };
  ``` 
  - **Members are always captured by reference.** `[this]` implies that members are accessed through this rather than copied into the lambda.
  - `[this]` and `[=]` are incompatible.
***
- `mutable` 
  ```C++
  void algo(vector<int>& v)
  {
    int count = v.size();
    std::generate(v.begin(),v.end(),
      [count]()mutable{ return −−count; }
    );
  }
  ``` 
  - The `−−count` decrements the copy of v’s size stored in the closure.
***
- Call and Return
  - There are two difference from normal functions:
    - If a lambda expression does not take any arguments, **the argument list can be omitted**. Thus, the minimal lambda expression is `[]{}`.
    - If a lambda body consists of just **a single return-statement**, the lambda expression’s return type **can be deduced from its body**.
  ```c++
  void g(double y)
  {
    [&]{ f(y); } // return type is void

    auto z1 = [=](int x){ return x+y; }  // return type is double  
    auto z2 = [=,y]{ if (y) return 1; else return 2; } // error : body too complicated for return type deduction 

    auto z3 =[y]() { return 1 : 2; } // return type is int 
    auto z4 = [=,y]()−>int { if (y) return 1; else return 2; }  // OK: explicit return type
  }
  ``` 
  - When the suffix **return type notation is used, we cannot omit the argument list**.
***
- Type of Lambda
  - To allow for optimized versions of lambda expressions, the type of a lambda expression is not defined.
  - We can use a lambda to initialize a variable
    - Declared `auto` 
    - Declared `std::function<R(AL)>` 
      - `R` is the lambda’s return type 
      - `AL` is its argument list of types
  ```C++
  auto rev = [&rev](char* b, char* e)
    { if (1<e−b) { swap(*b,*−−e); rev(++b,e); } }; // error

  void f(string& s1, string& s2)
  {
    function<void(char* b, char* e)> rev =
      [&](char* b, char* e) { if (1<e−b) { swap(*b,*−−e); rev(++b,e); } };

    rev(&s1[0],&s1[0]+s1.size());
    rev(&s2[0],&s2[0]+s2.size());
  }

  void g(vector<string>& vs1, vector<string>& vs2)
  {
    auto rev = [&](char* b, char* e) { while (1<e−b) swap(*b++,*−−e); };
    
    rev(&s1[0],&s1[0]+s1.size());
    rev(&s2[0],&s2[0]+s2.size());
  }
  ``` 
  - We cannot use an `auto` variable before its type has been deduced (recursive).
  - If we just want to name a lambda, rather than using it recursively, `auto` can simplify things.
  ```C++
  double (*p1)(double) = [](double a) { return sqrt(a); }; 
  double (*p2)(double) = [&](double a) { return sqrt(a); }; // error : the lambda captures
  double (*p3)(int) = [](int a) { return sqrt(a); }; // error : argument types do not match
  ``` 
  - A lambda that captures nothing can be assigned to a **pointer to function** of an appropriate type

## Explicit Type Conversion
- Many such conversions are done *implicitly* according to the language rules.
- C++ offers explicit type conversion operations:
  - **Construction**, using the {} notation
  - Named conversions
    - `const_cast` for getting write access to something declared `const` 
    - `static_cast` for reversing a well-defined implicit conversion
    - `reinterpret_cast` for changing the meaning of bit patterns
    - `dynamic_cast` for dynamically checked class hierarchy navigation
  - C-style casts: *DANGEROUS*
  - Functional notation: *DANGEROUS*
```c++
template<class Target, class Source>
Target narrow_cast(Source v) {
  auto r = static_cast<Target>(v); // convert the value to the target type
  if (static_cast<Source>(r)!=v)
    throw runtime_error("narrow_cast<>() failed");
  return r;
}

void test(double d, int i, char* p) {

  auto c1 = narrow_cast<char>(64);
  auto c2 = narrow_cast<char>(−64); // will throw if chars are unsigned
  auto c3 = narrow_cast<char>(264); // will throw if chars are 8-bit and signed
 

  auto d1 = narrow_cast<double>(1/3.0F); // OK 
  auto f1 = narrow_cast<float>(1/3.0); // will probably throw

  auto c4 = narrow_cast<char>(i); // may throw 
  auto f2 = narrow_cast<float>(d); // may throw

  auto p1 = narrow_cast<char*>(i); // compile-time error 
  auto i1 = narrow_cast<int>(p); // compile-time error

  auto d2 = narrow_cast<double>(i); // may throw (but probably will not) 

  auto i2 = narrow_cast<int>(d); // may throw
}
```
- Except for the {} construction notation, other conversion is recommended.
- Use a homemade explicit conversion function, `narrow_cast`, where a value might be narrowed.
- It may be worthwhile to use a range test for floating-point conversions, rather than `!=`.

- Construction
  ```c++
  auto d1 = double{2};
  double d2 {double{2}/4};

  void f(int);
  void f(double);

  void g(int i, double d)
  {
    f(i); // call f(int) 
    f(double{i}); // error : {} doesn’t do int to floating conversion

    f(d); // call f(double)
    f(int{d}); // error : {} doesn’t truncate
    f(static_cast<int>(d)); // call f(int) with a truncated value

    f(round(d)); // call f(double) with a rounded value
    f(static_cast<int>(lround(d)));  // call f(int) with a rounded value
  }
  ```
  - `T{v}` notation is that it will perform **only "well-behaved" conversions**.
  - "Reasonably well behaved" is defined as having a "non-narrowing" conversion
  - Truncation of floating-point numbers (e.g., 7.9 to 7) doesn't "well behaved"
  - **`{}`-construction doesn’t allow `int` to `double` conversion**
  ```C++
  template<class T> void f(const T&);

  void g3()
  {
    f(int{}); // default int value 
    f(complex<double>{}); // default complex value
    // ...
  }
  ``` 
  - The constructor notation `T{}` is used to express the default value of type `T`.
  - `int{}` is another way of writing `0`.
  - `T{}` is defined by the **default constructor**, if any, otherwise by **default construction of each member**.
***
- Named Casts
  - Explicit type conversion, often called *casting*, is occasionally essential.
  - Traditionally it is seriously overused and a major source of errors.
  - In C++, explicit type conversion is unnecessary in most cases when C needs it
  - Named casts is to **make type conversion more visible** and to allow the programmer to express the intent of a cast.
    - `static_cast`: converts between **related** types (class hierarchy, integral type to enumeration, floating-point type to integral type).
    - `reinterpret_cast`: handles conversions between **unrelated** types.
    - `const_cast` converts between types that differ only in `const` and `volatile` qualifiers.
    - `dynamic_cast` does **run-time checked conversion** of pointers and references into a class hierarchy.
  ```c++
  void* my_allocator(size_t);
  void f()
  {
    int* p = static_cast<int*>(my_allocator(100)); // new allocation used as ints
    // ...
  }
  ``` 
  - A compiler does not know the type of the object pointed to by the `void*`.
  ```c++
  char x = 'a';
  int* p1 = &x; // error : no implicit char* to int* conversion
  int* p2 = static_cast<int*>(&x); // error : no implicit char* to int* conversion
  int* p3 = reinterpret_cast<int*>(&x); // OK: on your head be it

  struct B { /* ... */ };
  struct D : B { /* ... */ };

  B* pb = new D; // OK: implicit conversion from D* to B*
  D* pd = pb;  // error : no implicit conversion from B* to D*
  D* pd = static_cast<D*>(pb); // OK
  ``` 
  - Some `static_cast`s are portable, but few `reinterpret_cast`s are.
  - The result of a reinterpret_cast is guaranteed to be usable only if its result is converted back to the exact original type.
***
- C-Style Cast
  - C++ inherited the notation `(T)e`, which performs any conversion.
  - C-style cast can also cast from a pointer to a class to a pointer to a private base of that class.
  - `(T)e` might be doing a portable conversion between related types, a nonportable conversion between unrelated types, or removing the const modifier from a pointer type
  - C-style cast is **far more dangerous than the named conversion operators**.
- Function-Style Cast
  ```C++
  void f(double d) {
    int i = int(d); // truncate d
    complex z = complex(d); // make a complex from d
    // ...
  }
  ```
  - `T(e)` construct is sometimes referred to as a function-style cast.
  - For a **built-in type** `T`, `T(e)` is equivalent to `(T)e`
  - Prefer `T{v}` conversions for well-behaved construction and the named casts.
