## Desk Calculator
- Requirement
  - Four standard arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
  - The can also define variables.
- The calculator consists of four main parts:
  - Parser: does the syntactic analysis.
  - Input function: handles input and lexical analysis.
  - Symbol table: holds permanent information.
  - Driver: handles initialization, output, and errors.
- Actually, it is a miniature compiler.
***
- Parser
  - Grammar tree
    - program:
      - `end`
      - *expr_list* `end`
    - *expr_list*:
      - *expression* `print`
      - *expression* `print` *expr_list*
    - *expression*:
      - *expression* `+` *term*
      - *expression* `−` *term*
      - *term*
    - *term*:
      - *term* `/` *primary*
      - *term* `*` *primary*
      - *primary*
    - *primary*:
      - number
      - name
      - name `=` *expression*
      - `−`*primary*
      - `(` *expression* `)`
  - The basic units of an expression are numbers, names, and the operators `*`, `/`, `+`, `−` (both unary and binary), and `=` (assignment).
  - Terminal symbols (for example, `end`, number, `+`, and `−`) are recognized by a lexical analyzer
  - Nonterminal symbols are recognized by the **syntax analyzer functions**, `expr()`, `term()`, and `prim()`.
  - For input, the parser uses a `Token_stream` that encapsulates the reading of characters and their composition into `Token`s.
    - To read the **next** Token, it calls `ts.get()`.
    - To get the most recently read, it calls `ts.current()`.

  ```c++
  enum class Kind : char {
    name, number, end,
    plus='+', minus='−', mul='*', div='/', print=';', assign='=', lp='(', rp=')'
  };

  double expr(bool);

  double prim(bool get) // handle primaries
  {
    if (get) ts.get(); // read next token

    switch (ts.current().kind)
    {
      case Kind::number: // floating-point constant
      {
        double v = ts.current().number_value;
        ts.get();
        return v;
      }
      case Kind::name:
      {
        double& v = table[ts.current().string_value]; // find the corresponding 
        if (ts.get().kind == Kind::assign) v = expr(true); // '=' seen: assignment
        return v;
      }
      case Kind::minus: // unary minus
        return −prim(true);
      case Kind::lp:
      {
        auto e = expr(true);
        if (ts.current().kind != Kind::rp) return error("')' expected");
        ts.get(); // eat ')'
        return e;
      }
      default:
        return error("primary expected");
    }
  }

  double term(bool get) // multiply and divide
  {
    double left = prim(get);
    
    for (;;) {
      switch (ts.current().kind) {
      case Kind::mul:
        left *= prim(true);
        break;
      case Kind::div:
        if (auto d = prim(true)) {
          left /= d;
          break;
        }
        return error("divide by 0");
      default:
        return left;
      }
    }
  }

  double expr(bool get) // add and subtract
  { 
    double left = term(get);
    
    for (;;) {
      switch (ts.current().kind) { 
        case Kind::plus:
          left += term(true);
          break;
        case Kind::minus:
          left −= term(true);
          break;
        default:
          return left; 
      }
    }
  }
  ``` 
  - It uses a style of syntax analysis called *recursive descent*.
  - As soon as **both operands** of a (sub)expression are known, the expression is evaluated.
  - Each parser function takes a `bool` argument, called `get`, indicating whether the function needs to call `Token_stream::get()` to get the next token.
  - `prim()` is lower in the call hierarchy a bit of real work is being done and no loop is necessary.
  - `prim()` always reads one more Token because it must do that in some cases, so for consistency it must do it in all cases.
  - The symbol table is a `map<string,double> table;`
  - `expr()` calls `term()`, which calls `prim()`, which in turn calls `expr()`. This loop of calls must be broken somehow. Thus, we put `double expr(bool);` before the definition of prim().
***
- Input
  - The task of a low-level input routine is to read characters and compose higher-level tokens from them.
  ```C++
  struct Token {
    Kind kind;
    string string_value;
    double number_value;
  };

  class Token_stream {
  public:
    Token_stream(istream& s) : ip{&s}, owns{false} { }
    Token_stream(istream* p) : ip{p}, owns{true} { }

    ~Token_stream() { close(); }

    Token get();  // read and return next token 
    Token& current(); // most recently read token

    void set_input(istream& s) { close(); ip = &s; owns=false; }
    void set_input(istream* p) { close(); ip = p; owns = true; }

  private:

    void close() { if (owns) delete ip; }
    
    istream* ip; // pointer to an input stream
    bool owns; // does the Token_stream own the istream?
    Token ct {Kind::end} ; // current token
  };
  ``` 
  - Representing each token by the integer value of its character is convenient and efficient and **can be a help to people using debuggers**.
  - When a Token that is a number, its value is placed in its `number_value`. Similarly, when a Token that is a name, its value is placed in its string_value. 
  - It is a useful and general technique for classes that hold a **pointer (`istream`) to a resource requiring destruction**.
  - People should not call `current()` before `get()`, but if they do, they get a well-default Token.
  ```C++
  Token Token_stream::get()
  {
    char ch = 0;
    *ip>>ch;

    switch (ch) { 
    case 0:
      return ct={Kind::end};  // assign and return

    case ';':  // end of expression; print
    case '*':
    case '/':
    case '+':
    case '−':
    case '(':
    case ')':
    case '=': 
      return ct=={static_cast<Kind>(ch)};
      
    case '0': case '1': case '2': case '3': case '4': case '5': case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9': case '.':
      ip−>putback(ch); // put the first digit (or .) back into the input stream
      *ip >> ct.number_value; // read number into ct
      ct.kind=Kind::number;
      return ct;
      
    default: // name, name =, or error
      if (isalpha(ch)) {
        ip−>putback(ch); // put the first character back into the input stream
        *ip>>ct.string_value; // read string into ct
        ct.kind=Kind::name;
        return ct;
      }
      error("bad token");
      return ct={Kind::print};
    }
  }
  ``` 
  - **By default, operator `>>` skips whitespace** and leaves the value of ch unchanged if the input operation failed.
  - The `static_cast` is needed because there is no implicit conversion from `char` to `Kind`.
  - This `Token_stream::get()` is a simple version that **imposes a burden on the user**.
    - It is tedious to remember to add a semicolon after an expression in order to get its value printed.
    - Having a name terminated by whitespace only is a real nuisance.
  ```c++
  Token Token_stream::get()
  {
    char ch;
    // *ip >> ch;
    
    do { // skip whitespace except '\n'
      if (!ip−>get(ch)) return ct={Kind::end};
    } while (ch!='\n' && isspace(ch));

    switch (ch) { 
    case ';':
    case '\n':
      return ct={Kind::print};
    case '*':
    case '/':
    case '+':
    case '−':
    case '(':
    case ')':
    case '=': 
      return ct=={static_cast<Kind>(ch)};
      
    case '0': case '1': case '2': case '3': case '4': case '5': case '6': case '7': case '8': case '9': case '.':
      ip−>putback(ch); // put the first digit (or .) back into the input stream
      *ip >> ct.number_value; // read number into ct
      ct.kind=Kind::number;
      return ct;
      
    default: // name, name =, or error
      // if (isalpha(ch)) {
      //   ip−>putback(ch); // put the first character back into the input stream
      //   *ip>>ct.string_value; // read string into ct
      //   ct.kind=Kind::name;
      //   return ct;
      // }
      if (isalpha(ch)) {
        string_value = ch;
        while (ip−>get(ch) && isalnum(ch)) // A*B = 5
          string_value += ch; // append ch to end of string_value
        ip−>putback(ch);
        return ct={Kind::name};
      }
      error("bad token");
      return ct={Kind::print};
    }
  }
  ``` 
  - We make a newline equivalent to the semicolon used to mark the end-of-expression
  - **By default, `get()` does not skip whitespace and newline the way `>>` does**.
  - The standard-library provides several functions to check the character
    - `isspace(c)`: returns a nonzero value if `c` is a whitespace character and zero otherwise.
    - `isdigit()`: test if a character is a digit
    - `isalpha()`: test if a character is a letter
    - `isalnum()`: test if a character is a digit or letter
  - The problem caused by `>>` reading into a string until whitespace is encountered is solved by reading one character at a time until a character that is not a letter or a digit is found
    - Previous `Token_stream::get()` will treat "A*B=5" as a token with a name_string `A*B=5`
    - New `Token_stream::get()` will treat "A*B=5" as five tokens: `A`, `*`, `B`, `=`, and `5`
  - All modern string implementations provide the "small string optimization", so adding characters to the end of a string one by one wouldn't be inefficient.
    - The maximum number of characters for a *short string* is implementation-dependent
    - Usually, string length 14 would be a good guess
***
- Error Handling
  ```C++
  int no_of_errors;

  double error(const string& s) {
    no_of_errors++;
    cerr << "error: " << s << '\n';
    return 1;
  }
  ```
  - It is always important to detect and report errors.
  - The error() function simply counts the errors, writes out an error message, and returns.
  - **The reason for returning** is that errors typically occur in the middle of the evaluation of an expression, so we should either **abort that evaluation entirely** or **return a value that is unlikely to cause subsequent errors**.
***
- The driver
  ```C++
  #include<iostream> // I/O
  #include<sstream> // istringstream
  #include<string> // strings
  #include<map> // map
  #include<cctype> // isalpha(), etc.

  using namespace std;

  Token_stream ts {cin}; // use input from cin

  void calculate()
  {
    for (;;) {
      ts.get();
      if (ts.current().kind == Kind::end) break;
      if (ts.current().kind == Kind::print) continue;
      cout << expr(false) << '\n';
    }
  }

  int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    switch (argc) {
    case 1: // read from standard input
      break;  
    case 2: // read from argument string
      ts.set_input(new istringstream{argv[1]});
      break; 
    default:
      error("too many arguments");
      return 1;
    }

    table["pi"] = 3.1415926535897932385; // insert predefined names
    table["e"] = 2.7182818284590452354;

    calculate();

    return no_of_errors;
  }
  ```
  - We need only a driver to start things.
  - `main()` to do setup and error reporting.
  - `calculate()` to handle the actual calculation.
  - `main()` returns zero if the program terminates normally and nonzero otherwise
  - Testing for `Kind::print` relieves `expr()` of the responsibility for handling empty expressions.
  - `main()` is given two arguments
    - The number of arguments, conventionally called `argc`.
    - An array of arguments, conventionally called `argv`.
    - The arguments are C-style character strings, so the type of `argv` is `char*[argc+1]`.
    - **The name of the program is passed as `argv[0]`, so argc is always at least 1.**
    - Run `dc "rate=1.1934;150/rate;19.75/rate;217/rate"`.
  - To read from the command string in the same way that we read from the input stream, `istringstream` is used.
  ```C++
  vector<string> arguments(int argc, char* argv[])
  {
    vector<string> res;
    for (int i = 0; i!=argc; ++i)
      res.push_back(argv[i]);
    return res;
  }
  ```
  - **`argc` and `argv` are still a source of minor, yet annoying, bugs**.

- Each operator is followed by one or more names commonly used for it.
- You can define meanings for operators applied to operands of user-defined types.
- *Max Munch rule*: The longest possible sequence of characters is chosen to make a token.
  - `&&` is a single operator, rather than two `&` operators
  - `a+++1` means `(a ++) + 1`.
- Whitespace characters (e.g., space, tab, and newline) can be token separators.
- Some programmers find it odd to use of symbols, such as `&&` and `~`. Consequently, a set of alternative representation are provided.
  - `and` (`&`)
  - `and_eq` (`&=`)
  - `bitand` (`&)`
  - `bitor` (`|)`
  - `compl` (`~`)
  - `not` (`!`)
  - `not_eq` (`!=`)
  - `or` (`|)`
  - `or_eq` (`|=`)
  - `xor` (`ˆ)`
  - `xor_eq` ˆ(`=`)
*** 
- Result
  ```c++
  void f(int x, int y)
  {
    int j = x = y; // the value of x=y is the value of x after the assignment
    int* p = &++x; // p points to x
    int* q = &(x++); // error : x++ is not an lvalue (it is not the value stored in x)
    int* p2 = &(x>y?x:y); // address of the int with the larger value 
    int& r = (x<y)?x:1; // error : 1 is not an lvalue
  }
  ``` 
  - Where logically feasible, **the result of an operator that takes an lvalue operand is an lvalue denoting that lvalue operand**.
  - Preserving lvalues in this way allows greater flexibility in using operators.
  - The result of `sizeof` is of an unsigned integral type called `size_t` defined in `<cstddef>`.
  - The result of pointer subtraction is of a signed integral type called `ptrdiff_t` defined in `<cstddef>`.
  ```c++
  void f()
  {
    int i = 1;
    while (0 < i) ++i;
    cout << "i has become negative!" << i << '\n';
  }
  ``` 
  - What happens then is undefined, but typically the value **"wraps around" to a negative number**.
  - The effect of **dividing by zero** is undefined, but doing so usually causes abrupt termination of the program.
  - In particular, **underflow, overflow, and division by zero do not throw standard exceptions**.
***
- Order of Evaluation
  - **The order of evaluation of subexpressions within an expression is undefined**.
    - The operators `,`, `&&`, and `||` guarantee that their **left-hand operand is evaluated before their right-hand operand**.
    - The second operand of `&&` is evaluated only if its first operand is true, called *short-circuit evaluation*.
  - Be careful not to write an expression that reads or writes an object more than once.
  ```C++
  int x = f(2)+g(3); // undefined whether f() or g() is called first

  int i = 1;
  v[i] = i++; // undefined result
  ```
  - The assignment may be evaluated as either `v[1]=1` or `v[2]=1`.
  ```C++
  b=(a=2,a+1) // b = 3

  f1(v[i],i++); // two arguments 
  f2( (v[i],i++) ); // one argument
  ``` 
  - Sequencing operator `,` is logically different from the comma used to separate arguments in a function call.
  - `(v[i],i++)`, which is equivalent to `i++`, is confusing, so that too should be avoided.
***
- Operator Precedence
  - Use of parentheses becomes more common as the subexpressions become more complicated.
  - Since complicated subexpressions are a source of errors, you should consider **breaking up the expression by using an extra variable**.
  - `if (i&mask == 0)`
    - `==` has higher precedence than `&`
    - It is easy enough for a compiler to warn about most such mistakes.
  - `if (0 <= x <= 99)`
    - It is interpreted as `(0<=x)<=99`.
    - Boolean value is then implicitly converted to 1 or 0, and thus the condition is always `true`.
  - `if (a = 7)`
    - A common mistake for novices is to use `=` (assignment) instead of `==` (equals).
    - Use `if (7 == a)` to protect against misuse of `=`.

## Temporary Objects
- For `v=x+y*z`, the result of `y*z` has to be put somewhere before it is added to `x`.
- For **built-in types**, a temporary object **is invisible** to the user.
- **A temporary object is destroyed at the end of the full expression**.
  - **A reference or an initialized named object** will *not* be destroyed at the end of the full expression.
  - A *full expression* is an expression that is not a subexpression of some other expression.
```C++
void f(string& s1, string& s2, string& s3)
{
  const char* cs = (s1+s2).c_str();
  cout << cs;
  if (strlen(cs=(s2+s3).c_str())<8 && cs[0]=='a') {
    // cs used here
  }
}
``` 
- `c_str()` returns a C-style pointer to a zero-terminated array of characters.
- A temporary string object is created to hold `s1+s2` and then – at the end of the expression – the temporary object is deleted.
- **The storage to which `cs` points is not guaranteed to exist after that temporary is destroyed**. In other words, cs points to deallocated storage.
- The problem with the `if`-statement is a bit more subtle.
  - The condition will work as expected.
  - The temporary is destroyed before the controlled statement is entered, so any use of cs there is not guaranteed to work.
- The problems with temporaries arose from using a high-level data type in a low-level way.
```c++
void f(string& s1, string& s2, string& s3)
{
  cout << s1+s2; 
  if (s.length()<8 && s[0]=='a') {
    // use s here
  }
}
```
- A cleaner programming style yields a more understandable program fragment and avoids the problems with temporaries completely. 
```C++
void g(const string&, const string&);

void h(string& s1, string& s2)
{
  const string& s = s1+s2;
  string ss = s1+s2;
  g(s,ss);
  // we can use s and ss here
}
``` 
- A temporary can be used as an initializer for a `const` reference or a named object.
- The temporary is destroyed when its reference or named object goes out of scope.
- **A temporary object cannot be bound to a non-const lvalue reference**.
- Returning a reference to a local variable is an error.
```c++
void f(Shape& s, int n, char ch)
{
  s.move(string{n,ch}); // construct a string with n copies of ch to pass to Shape::move()
  // ...
}
```
- A temporary object can be created explicitly in an expression by invoking a constructor.

## Constant Expressions
- There are a variety of reasons why someone might want a named constant
  - There are a variety of reasons why someone might want a named constant.
  - A variable might be changed.
  - The language requires constant expressions for array sizes, `case` labels, and `template` value arguments.
  - Embedded systems programmers like to put immutable data into read-only memory because read-only memory is cheaper than dynamic memory.
  - If initialization is done at compile time, there can be no data races.
  - Sometimes, evaluating something once gives significantly better performance.
- The most important single use of constants is simply to provide **symbolic names** for values.
  - Symbolic names should be used systematically to avoid "magic numbers" in code.
  - Left as numeric constants in the code, these values are hard for a maintainer to spot and understand.
  - Such numeric values go unnoticed and become errors when a program is ported or when some other change violates the assumptions they represent. R
***
- `constexpr`
  - `constexpr`'s role is to enable and ensure compile-time evaluation
  - A *constant expression* cannot use values that are **not known at compile time** and it **cannot have side effects**.
  - A constant expression must start out with
    - integral value
    - floating-point value
    - enumerator
    - *literal type*
    - some addresses
  - Usually, `constexpr` is a better choice than const for defining **simple constants**,
  - It is new in C++11, so older code tends to use `const`.
  ```c++
  int x1 = 7;
  constexpr int x2 = 7;

  constexpr int x3 = x1; // error : initializer is not a constant expression 
  constexpr int x4 = x2; // OK

  void f()
  {
    constexpr int y3 = x1; // error : initializer is not a constant expression
    constexpr int y4 = x2; // OK
    // ... 
  }

  constexpr int isqrt_helper(int sq, int d, int a)
  {
    return sq <= a ? isqrt_helper(sq+d,d+2,a) : d;
  }
  
  constexpr int isqrt(int x)
  {
    return isqrt_helper(1,3,x)/2 − 1;
  }
  
  constexpr int s1 = isqrt(9); // s1 becomes 3 
  constexpr int s2 = isqrt(1234);
  ``` 
  - If the initializer for a `constexpr` can't be evaluated at compile time, the compiler will give an error.
    - We prefer not to rely on degrees of cleverness in compilers.
    - In a large program, determining the values of variables at compile time is typically either very difficult or impossible.
  - We can use any operator that doesn't modify state (e.g., `+`, `?:`, and `[]`).
  ```C++
  template<> class complex<double> {
  public:
    constexpr complex(double re = 0.0, double im = 0.0);
    constexpr complex(const complex<float>&);
    explicit constexpr complex(const complex<long double>&);

    constexpr double real(); // read the real part
    oid real(double); // set the real part
    constexpr double imag(); // read the imaginary part
    void imag(double); // set the imaginary part

    complex<double>& operator= (double);
    complex<double>& operator+=(double);
    // ...
  };

  constexpr complex<float> z1 {1,2}; // note: <float> not <double>

  constexpr double re = z1.real();
  constexpr double im = z1.imag();
  constexpr complex<double> z2 {re,im}; // z2 becomes a copy of z1 
  constexpr complex<double> z3 {z1}; // z3 becomes a copy of z1
  ``` 
  - `constexpr` is all about values.
  - `constexpr` provides a miniature compile-time functional programming language.
  - You might guess that constexpr cannot deal with references, but that's only partially true because **const references refer to values and can therefore be used**.
  
  - Operations, such as `=` and `+=`, that modify an object cannot be `constexpr`.
  - Operations that simply read an object, such as `real()` and `imag()`, can be constexpr and be evaluated at compile time.
  - The copy constructor works because the compiler recognizes that the reference (the `const complex<float>&`) refers to a constant value.
  ```C++
  constexpr const char* p1 = "asdf";
  constexpr const char* p2 = p1; // OK 
  constexpr const char* p2 = p1+2; // error : the compiler does not know the value of p1
  constexpr char c = p1[2]; // OK, c=='d'; the compiler knows the value pointed to by p1
  ```
  - **The address of a statically allocated object,** such as a global variable, is a constant.
  - However, its value is assigned by the linker, so the **compiler cannot know the value of such an address constant**.
***
- `const`
  - A `const` is primarily used to express interfaces.
  - A `const` differs from a `constexpr` in that it can be initialized by something that is not a constant expression.
  - In many cases, enumerators are another alternative to `const`s.
  ```C++
  const int x = 7;
  const string s = "asdf";
  const int y = sqrt(x);

  constexpr int xx = x; // OK 
  constexpr string ss = s; // error: s is not a constant expression 
  constexpr int yy = y; // error: sqr t(x) is not a constant expression
  ``` 
  - The reasons for the errors are that
    - **`string` is not a literal type**.
    - `sqrt()` is not a `constexpr` function.
*** 
- **_Literal Types_**
  - A sufficiently simple user-defined type can be used in a constant expression.
  - A class with a **`constexpr` constructor** is called a *literal type*.
    - A constructor must have an empty body.
    - **All members** must be initialized by potentially **constant expressions**.
  ```C++
  struct Point {
    int x,y,z;
    constexpr Point up(int d) { return {x,y,z+d}; }
    constexpr Point move(int dx, int dy) { return {x+dx,y+dy}; }
    // ...
  };

  constexpr Point origo {0,0};
  constexpr int z = origo.x;

  constexpr Point a[] = {
    origo,
    Point{1,1},
    Point{2,2},
    origo.move(3,3)
  };
  constexpr int x = a[1].x; // x becomes 1

  constexpr Point xy{0,sqrt(2)}; // error : sqr t(2) is not a constant expression
  ```

## Implicit Type Conversion
- Wherever possible, values are converted so as not to lose information.
- Some value destroying ("narrowing") conversions are also performed implicitly.
*** 
- Promotions
  - **Implicit conversions that preserve values** are commonly referred to as *promotions*.
  - Promotions will not promote to `long` or `long double`.
  - Promotions bring operands to the "natural" size for arithmetic operations.
  - A `char`, `signed char`, `unsigned char`, `short int`, or `unsigned short int` is converted to an `int` or `unsigned int`.
  - A `char16_t`, `char32_t`, `wchar_t`, or a plain enumeration type is converted to `int`, `unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`, or `unsigned long long`.
  - A bit-field is converted to an `int` or `unsigned int`.
  - A `bool` is converted to an `int`; `false` becomes `0` and `true` becomes `1`.
***
- Conversions
  - **Avoid undefined behavior and conversions** that quietly throw away information ("narrowing conversions")
  - If  narrowing conversions are unavoidable, consider using some form of **run-time checked conversion function**, such as `narrow_cast<>()`.
  ```c++
  unsigned char uc = 1023;// binary 1111111111: uc becomes binary 11111111, that is, 255
  signed char sc = 1023; // implementation-defined
  ```
  - If the destination type is signed, the value is unchanged if it can be represented.
  - Otherwise, the value is implementation-defined. Plausible results are `127` and `−1`.
  ```c++
  float f = FLT_MAX; // largest float value 
  double d = f; // OK: d == f

  double d2 = DBL_MAX; // largest double value
  float f2 = d2; // undefined if FLT_MAX<DBL_MAX
 
  long double ld = d2; // OK: ld = d3
  long double ld2 = numeric_limits<long double>::max();
  double d3 = ld2; // undefined if sizeof(long double) > sizeof(double)
  ``` 
  - If the source value is between two adjacent destination values, the result is one of those values.
  - Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
  - `DBL_MAX` and `FLT_MAX` are defined in `<climits>`; `numeric_limits` is defined in `<limits>`.
  - Pointer and Reference Conversions
    - Any pointer to an object type can be implicitly converted to a `void*`.
      - A pointer to function or a pointer to member cannot be implicitly converted to a `void*`.
    - A pointer (reference) can be implicitly converted to a pointer (reference) to a base.
    - `0` can be implicitly converted to a null pointer.
    - `T*` can be implicitly converted to a const `T*`.
    - `T&` can be implicitly converted to a const `T&`.
  - Boolean Conversions: **Pointer**, integral, and floating-point values can be implicitly converted to `bool`.
  - Floating-Integral Conversions
    ```c++
    int i = 2.7; // i becomes 2
    char b = 2000.7;  // undefined for 8-bit chars: 2000 cannot be represented as an 8-bit char

    int i = float(1234567890); // data loss
    ``` 
    - When a floating-point value is converted to an integer value, the fractional part is discarded or truncated.
    - Conversions from integer to floating types are as mathematically correct as the hardware allows.
    - Loss of precision occurs if an integral value cannot be represented exactly as a value of the floating type.
    ```C++
    char checked_cast(int i) { 
      char c = i; // warning: not portable
      if (i != c) throw std::runtime_error{"int−to−char check failed"};
      return c;
    }

    void my_code(int i) {
      char c = checked_cast(i);
      // ...
    }
    ``` 
    - General compile-time detection is impractical, so the programmer must be careful.
