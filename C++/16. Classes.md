## Class Basics
```c++
class X {
private: // the representation (implementation) is private
  int m;
public: // the user interface is public
  X(int i =0) :m{i} { } // a constructor (initialize the data member m)

  int mf(int i)  // a member function
  {
    int old = m;
    m = i; // set a new value
    return old; // return the old value
  }

};

X var {7}; // a variable of type X, initialized to 7

int user(X var, X* ptr)
{
  int x = var.mf(7); // access using . (dot) 
  int y = ptr−>mf(9); // access using -> (arrow) 
  int z = var.m; // error : cannot access private member
}
```
- Summary of classes
  - A class is a user-defined type.
  - A class consists of a set of members. The most common kinds of members are data members and member functions.
  - Member functions can define the meaning of initialization , copy, move, and cleanup.
  - Members are accessed using `.` (dot) for objects and `−>` (arrow) for pointers.
  - Operators, such as `+`, `!`, and `[]`, can be defined for a class.
  - A class is a *namespace* containing its members.
  - The `public` members provide the class's interface and the private members provide implementation details.
  - **A `struct` is a class where members are by default `public`**.
- By default, the copy of a class object is a copy of each member.
  - the default semantics is memberwise copy.
  - the user can define an appropriate assignment operator.
  - An initialization with an `=` is considered a copy initialization.
```c++
struct Date { // representation
  int d, m, y;

  void init(int, int, int); // initialize d 
  void add_year(int n); // add n years to d
  void add_month(int n);  // add n months to d
  void add_day(int n); // add n days to d
};

void Date::init(int dd, int mm, int yy)
{
  d = dd;
  m = mm;
  y = yy;
}

Date my_birthday;

void f()
{
  Date today;

  today.init(16,10,1996);4
  my_birthday.init(30,12,1950);

  Date tomorrow = today; 
  tomorrow.add_day(1); // ...
}
``` 
- A connection can be established by declaring the functions as members.
- Functions declared within a class definition are called *member functions*.
- Member functions and can be invoked only for a specific variable of the appropriate type using the standard syntax for structure member access.
- We must **specify the structure name when defining** a member function.
- In a member function, member names can be used without explicit reference to an object.
  - when `Date::init()` is invoked for today, `m=mm` assigns to `today.m`.
  - A class member function "knows" for which object it was invoked.
```c++
class Date { // representation
  int d, m, y;
public:
  void init(int dd, int mm, int yy); // initialize
  void add_year(int n); // add n years to d
  void add_month(int n);  // add n months to d
  void add_day(int n); // add n days to d
};

void Date::add_year(int n){
  y += n;
}

void timewarp(Date& d) {
  d.y −= 200; // error: Date::y is private
}
```
- `struct` doesn't provide access restriction that can be expressed by using a `class`.
- The `public` label separates the class body into two parts.
  - The names in the first, `private`, part can be used only by member functions.
  - The second, public, part constitutes the public interface to objects of the class.
- Nonmember functions are barred from using `private` members.
- **The protection of private data can therefore be circumvented** by address manipulation and explicit type conversion.
```c++
class Date3 {
public:
  Date3(int dd, int mm, int yy);
  void add_year(int n); // add n years
private:
  int d, m, y;
};
```
- It is not a requirement to declare data first in a class. 
- **It often makes sense to place data members last** to emphasize the functions providing the public user interface.
```c++
class Date4 {
public:
  Date4(int dd, int mm, int yy);
private:
  int d, m, y;
public:
  void add_year(int n); // add n years
};
``` 
- Access specifiers can be used many times in a single class declaration.
- Allowing many access specifiers in a class is *useful for machine-generated code*.
***
- `class` and `struct`
  - `class X { ... };` is called a *class definition*; **its members are private**.
    - For historical reasons, a *class definition* is often referred to as a *class declaration*.
    - A class definition can be replicated in different source files using #include without violating the one-definition rule
  - `struct S { /* ... */ };` is **a class in which members are by default public**.
    - It's equivalent to `class S { public: /* ... */ };`; **These two definitions of `S` are interchangeable**.
  - We tend to use `struct` for classes that I think of as "just simple data structures."; a class as "a proper type with an invariant."
***
- Constructors
  - A function constructing values of a given type is called a *constructor*.
  ```c++
  class Date {
    int d, m, y;
  public:
    Date(int dd, int mm, int yy); // constructor: day, month, year
    Date(int, int); // day, month, today's year
    Date(int);  // day, today's month and year
    Date(); // default Date: today
    Date(const char*);  // date in string representation
    // ...
  };
  ``` 
  - A constructor is recognized by having the **same name as the class itself**.
  - When a class has a constructor, all objects of that class will be initialized by a constructor call.
  - We can provide a variety of ways of initializing objects of a type. Constructors obey the same **overloading rules** as do ordinary functions.
  ```c++
  Date today = Date(23,6,1983);
  Date xmas(25,12,1990);  // abbreviated form 
  Date release1_0(10,12);

  Date today = Date {23,6,1983};
  Date xmas {25,12,1990}; // abbreviated form
  Date today {4}; // 4, today.m, today.y
  Date july4 {"July 4, 1983"};
  Date guy {5,11}; // 5, November, today.y
  Date now; // default initialized as today
  Date start {}; // default initialized as today
  ``` 
  - There are two methods to creating a object: `()` and `{}`
  - We **recommend the `{}` notation over the `()` notation** for initialization because it is explicit about what is being done.
    - There are cases where `()` notation must be used, but they are rare.
  ```c++
  class Date {
    int d, m, y;
  public:
    Date(int dd =0, int mm =0, int yy =0);
    // ...
  };

  Date::Date(int dd, int mm, int yy)
  {
    d = dd ? dd : today.d;
    m = mm ? mm : today.m;
    y = yy ? yy : today.y;

    // check that the Date is valid
  }

  class Date {
    int d, m, y;
  public:
    Date(int dd =today.d, int mm =today.m, int yy =today.y);
    // ...
  };
  ``` 
  - One way of reducing the number of related functions is to **use default arguments**
  - We could use the default values directly as default arguments.
  - We chose to use `0` to avoid building actual values into `Date`'s interface. That way, we have the option to later improve the implementation of the default.
***
- `explicit` Constructors
  - By default, a constructor acts as an implicit conversion from its argument type to its type.
    - If you define an implicit constructor, it is best to document your reason
  - A constructor declared with the keyword `explicit` can only be used for initialization and explicit conversions.
  ```c++
  class Date {
    int d, m, y;
  public:
  explicit Date(int dd =0, int mm =0, int yy =0);
  explicit Date(int dd);
    // ...
  };

  Date d1 {15}; // OK: considered explicit
  Date d2 = Date{15}; // OK: explicit
  Date d3 = {15}; // error: = initialization does not do implicit conversions
  Date d4 = 15; // error: = initialization does not do implicit conversions

  void f()
  {
    my_fct(15); // error: argument passing does not do implicit conversions
    my_fct({15}); // error: argument passing does not do implicit conversions
    my_fct(Date{15}); // OK: explicit
    // ...
  }

  Date::Date(int dd) { /* ... */ } // OK
  explicit Date::Date(int dd) { /* ... */ } // error
  ```
  - Leaving out the `=` makes the initialization explicit.
  - Explicit initialization is known as *direct initialization*.
  - If a constructor is declared `explicit` and defined outside the class, **that `explicit` cannot be repeated**.
***
- In-Class Initializers
  ```c++
  class Date {
    int d {today.d}; // In-Class Initializers
    int m {today.m};
    int y {today.y};
  public:
    Date(int, int, int); // day, month, year
    Date(int, int);  // day, month, today's year
    Date(int);  // day, today's month and year
    Date();  // default Date: today
    Date(const char*);  // date in string representation
    // ...
  }
  ``` 
  - When we use several constructors, member initialization can become repetitive.
  - we can add **initializers to data members**.
- In-Class Function Definitions
  - A member function defined **within the class definition is taken to be an inline member function**.
  - In-class definition of member functions is for small, rarely modified, frequently used functions.
  ```c++
  class Date {
  public:
    void add_month(int n) { m+=n; } // increment the Date's m
    // ...
  private:
    int d, m, y;
  };

  inline void Date::add_month(int n) // add n months
  {
    m+=n; // increment the Date's m
  }
  ``` 
  - A member function defined in-class **can be replicated identically** in several translation units using #include.
  - This style is often used to keep class definitions simple and easy to read.
***
- Mutability
  - A name can refer to an object that holds an immutable or a mutable value.
  - Systematic use of immutable objects leads to more comprehensible code, to more errors being found early, and sometimes to improved performance.
  - **A nonconst member function can be invoked only for non-const objects.**
  - **`const` does not apply (transitively) to objects accessed through pointers or references.**
  ```c++
  class Date {
    int d, m, y;
  public:
    int day() const { return d; }
    int month() const { return m; }
    int year() const;

    void add_year(int n); // add n years
    // ...
  };

  int Date::year() const
  {
    return ++y; // error: attempt to change member value in const function
  }
  ```
  - The `const` after the argument list indicates that it do not modify the state of a `Date`.
  - When a `const` *member function* is defined outside its class, **the `const` suffix is required**.
  ```c++
  class Date {
  public:
    // ...
    string string_rep() const; // string representation
  private:
    mutable bool cache_valid;
    mutable string cache;
    void compute_cache_value() const; // fill (mutable) cache
    // ...
  };

  string Date::string_rep() const {
    if (!cache_valid) {
      compute_cache_value();
      cache_valid = true;
    }
    return cache;
  }
  ``` 
  - Occasionally, a member function is logically const, but it still needs to change the value of a member.
  - To a user, the function appears not to change the state of its object, but some detail that the user cannot directly observe is updated. This is often called *logical constness*.
  - We **can define a member of a class to be `mutable`**, meaning that it can be modified even in a `const`.
  - Another way is through brute force using a cast, for example, a `const_cast`.
  ```c++
  struct cache {
    bool valid;
    string rep;
  };

  class Date {
  public:
    // ...
    string string_rep() const; // string representation
  private:
    cache* c;  // initialize in constructor
    void compute_cache_value() const;  // fill what cache refers to
    // ...
  };

  string Date::string_rep() const
  {
    if (!c−>valid) {
      compute_cache_value();
      c−>valid = true;
    }
    return c−>rep;
  }
  ``` 
  - More complicated cases are often better handled by placing the changing data in a separate object and accessing it indirectly.
  - the compiler does not know such pointers or references to be any different from any others. `const` doesn't work for pointers or references.
***
- Self-Reference
  - Each (non-static) member function knows for which object it was invoked and can explicitly refer to it.
  - `this` **is a pointer** to the object for which the function was invoked.
    - `this` is **considered an rvalue**, so it is not possible to take the address of this or to assign to this.
  - `*this` refers to the object for which a member function is invoked.
  ```c++
  class Date {
    // ...
    Date& add_year(int n); // add n years
    Date& add_month(int n); // add n months
    Date& add_day(int n); // add n days
  }

  Date& Date::add_year(int n)
  {
    if (d==29 && m==2 && !leapyear(y+n)) { // beware of February 29
      d = 1;
      m = 3;
    }

    y += n;
    return *this;
  }

  void f(Date& d)
  {
    // ...
    d.add_day(1).add_month(1).add_year(1);
    // ...
  }
  ``` 
  - For such a set of related update functions, it is often useful to return a reference to the updated object so that the operations can be chained.

  ```c++
  Date& Date::add_year(int n)
  {
    if (this−>d==29 && this−>m==2 && !leapyear(this−>y+n)) { // beware of February 29
      this−>d = 1;
      this−>m = 3;
    }

    this−>y += n;
    return *this;
  }
  ```
  - Most uses of `this` are implicit.
  - Every reference to a non-static member relies on an implicit use of `this` to get the member.
  ```c++
  struct Link {
    Link* pre;
    Link* suc;

    int data;

    Link* insert(int x) // insert x before this
    {
      return pre = new Link{pre,this,x};
    }

    void remove() // remove and destroy this
    {
      if (pre) pre−>suc = suc;
      if (suc) suc−>pre = pre;

      delete this;
    }

    // ...
  }
  ``` 
  - One common explicit use of this is in linked-list manipulation.
***
- Member Access
  ```c++
  struct X {
    void f();
    int m;
  };

  void user(X x, X* px) {
    m = 1; // error: there is no m in scope 
    x.m = 1; // OK
    x−>m = 1;  // error: x is not a pointer
    px−>m = 1; // OK 
    px.m = 1; // error: px is a pointer
  }
  ```
  - A member of a class `X` can be accessed by applying the `.` (dot) operator to an object of class X or by applying the `−>` (arrow) operator to a pointer to an object of class `X`.
  - An unqualified member name acts as if it had been prefixed by `this−>`.
  ```c++
  struct S {
    int m;
    int f();
    static int sm;
  };

  int X::f() { return m; } // X's f
  int X::sm {7};  // X's static member sm (§16.2.12)
  int (S::*) pmf() {&S::f};  // X's member f
  ``` 
  - If we want to refer to a member in general, rather than to a member of a particular object, we qualify by the class name followed by `::`.
***
- `static` Members
  - A variable that is part of a class, yet is not part of an object of that class, is called a `static` member.
  - There is exactly one copy of a static member instead of one copy per object.
  - In multi-threaded code, static data members require some kind of locking or access discipline.
  ```C++
  class Date {
    int d, m, y;
    static Date default_date;
  public:
    Date(int dd =0, int mm =0, int yy =0);
    // ...
    static void set_default(int dd, int mm, int yy); // set default_date to Date(dd,mm,yy)
  };

  Date Date::default_date {16,12,1770}; // definition of Date::default_date
  void Date::set_default(int d, int m, int y) // definition of Date::set_default
  {
    default_date = {d,m,y}; // assign new value to default_date
  }

  Date::Date(int dd, int mm, int yy)
  {
    d = dd ? dd : default_date.d;
    m = mm ? mm : default_date.m;
    y = yy ? yy : default_date.y;

    // ... check that the Date is valid ...
  }
  
  void f() {
    Date::set_default(4,5,1945);
  }
  ```
  - The keyword `static` is not repeated in the definition of a `static` member.
  - A `static` member can be referred to like any other member.
***
- Member Types
  - Types and type aliases can be members of a class.
  - A *member class* can refer to types and static members of its enclosing class.
  - Member classes are more a notational convenience.
  - Member enums are often an alternative to enum classes.
  ```c++
  template<typename T>
  class Tree {
    using value_type = T; // member alias
    enum Policy { rb, splay, treeps };  // member enum 
    class Node { // member class
      Node* right;
      Node* left;
      value_type value;
    public:
      void f(Tree*);
    };

    Node* top;
  public:
    void g(const T&);
    // ...
  };

  template<typename T>
  void Tree::Node::f(Tree* p)
  {
    top = right; // error : no object of type Tree specified
    p−>top = right; // OK 
    value_type v = left−>value; // OK: value_type is not associated with an object
  }

  template<typename T>
  void Tree::g(Tree::Node* p)
  {
    value_type val = right−>value;  // error : no object of type Tree::Node 
    value_type v = p−>right−>value; // error : Node::right is private
    p−>f(this); // OK
  }
  ```
  - A nested class has access to members of its enclosing class, **even to private members**.
  - A class does not have any special access rights to the members of its nested class.

## Concrete Classes
- C++ directly supports a few of abstractions as built-in types. However, most are not because there are too many of them.
- Mechanisms must be provided for the user to define small concrete types. Such types are called *concrete types*, *concrete classes*, or *value types*. It's to emphasize their similarity to built-in types.
- It distinguish them from *abstract classes* and classes in *class hierarchies*.
- A class is called *concrete* if **its representation is part of its definition**.
  - We prefer concrete classes for small, frequently used, and performance-critical types
  - The intent of a concrete type is to **do a single, relatively simple thing well and efficiently**.
  - In particular, concrete types are **not** intended to display run-time polymorphic behavior.
  - If you don't like some detail of a concrete type, you build a new one.
  - Derivation from a concrete class should be done with care and only rarely because of **the lack of virtual functions and run-time type information**

- Concrete types allows us
  - **To place objects on the stack**, in statically allocated memory, and in other objects.
  - To copy and move objects.
  - To refer directly to named objects (as opposed to accessing through pointers and references).

```c++
namespace Chrono {
  enum class Month { jan=1, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec };
  
  class Date {
  public: // public interface:
    class Bad_date { }; // exception class
    
    explicit Date(int dd ={}, Month mm ={}, int yy ={}); // {} means "pick a default"s

  // nonmodifying functions for examining the Date:
    int day() const;
    Month month() const;
    int year() const;

    string string_rep() const; // string representation
    void char_rep(char s[], in max) const; // C-style string representation

  // (modifying) functions for changing the Date:
    Date& add_year(int n); // add n years
    Date& add_month(int n); // add n months
    Date& add_day(int n); // add n days
  
  private:
    bool is_valid(); // check if this Date represents a date
    int d, m, y; // representation
  }

  bool is_date(int d, Month m, int y); // true for valid date 
  bool is_leapyear(int y); // true if y is a leap year

  bool operator==(const Date& a, const Date& b); 
  bool operator!=(const Date& a, const Date& b);

  const Date& default_date(); // the default date
  
  ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const Date& d); // print d to os
  istream& operator>>(istream& is, Date& d); // read Date from is into d
}
```
- This set of operations is fairly typical for a user-defined type
  1. A constructor.
  2. A set of functions allowing a user to examine a `Date`. These functions are marked const to indicate that they don't modify the stat.
  3. A set of functions allowing the user to modify `Date`s.
  4. Implicitly defined operations that allow Dates to be freely complicated.
  5. A class, `Bad_date`, to be used for reporting errors as **exceptions**.
  6. A set of **useful helper functions**. The helper functions are not members and have **no direct access to the representation** of a `Date`, but they are identified as related.
- `Month` the `{}` gives the (default) value 0 even though it is not a valid Month
- To simplify, we decided to eliminate the notion of changing the default date.
  - To preserve an opportunity for future refinement, `default_date()` is declared as a helper function.
- We chose January 1, 1970, because that is the starting point for the C and C++ standard-library time routines.
- `Date` doesn't need a destructor because a `Date` owns no resources and requires no cleanup when it goes out of scope.
***
- Member Functions
  ```c++
  Date::Date(int dd, Month mm, int yy)
    :d{dd}, m{mm}, y{yy}
  {
    if (y == 0) y = default_date().year();
    if (m == Month{}) m = default_date().month();
    if (d == 0) d = default_date().day();

    if (!is_valid()) throw Bad_date();
  }
  ``` 
  - If the arguments can't be a valid date, it throws an exception at the constructor.
    - The constructor establishes the invariant for the class.
  - We *member initializer* syntax to initialize the members. 
    - The use of member initializers leaves the structure of the code obvious.
    - Had we aimed at optimal performance, we would have used three separate constructors.
  ```c++
  bool Date::is_valid()
  {
    return is_date(d,m,y);
  }
  ``` 
  - We implemented `is_valid()` in terms of a helper function.
  - `is_date()` checks that a `(d,m,y)`-tuple represents a valid date.
  - `is_valid()` does an additional check on whether that date can be reasonably represented.
  ```c++
  inline int Date::day() const
  {
    return d;
  }

  Date& Date::add_month(int n)
  {
    if (n==0) return *this;

    if (n>0) {
      int delta_y = n/12; // number of whole years
      int mm = static_cast<int>(m)+n%12;  // number of months ahead 
      if (12 < mm) { // note: dec is represented by 12
        ++delta_y;
        mm −= 12;
      }

      // ... handle the cases where the month mm doesn't have day d ...

      y += delta_y;
      m = static_cast<Month>(mm);
      return *this;
    }

    // ... handle negative n ...
    return *this;
  }
  ```
  - A better representation  would be simply a number of days since a defined "day zero"
***
- Helper Functions
  - Typically, a class has a number of functions associated with it that need not be defined in the class itself because they don't need direct access to the representation.
  - Defining such functions in the class itself would complicate the class interface.
  ```c++
  namespace Chrono { // facilities for dealing with time
    class Date { /* ... */};

    int diff(Date a, Date b);
    bool is_leapyear(int y);
    bool is_date(int d, Month m, int y);
    const Date& default_date();
    Date next_weekday(Date d);
    Date next_saturday(Date d);
    // ...
  }
  ``` 
  - We can make the association explicit by enclosing the class and its helper functions in a namespace.
  - The `Chrono` namespace would naturally also contain related classes, such as `Time` and `Stopwatch`. Using a namespace to hold a single class is usually an overelaboration.
  ```c++
  bool Chrono::is_date(int d, Month m, int y)
  {
    int ndays;

    switch (m) {
    case Month::feb:
      ndays = 28+is_leapyear(y);
      break;
    case Month::apr: case Month::jun: case Month::sep: case Month::nov:
      ndays = 30;
      break;
    case Month::jan: case Month::mar: case Month::may: case Month::jul: case Month::aug: case Month::oct: case Month::dec:
      ndays = 31;
      break;
    default:
      return false; 
    }

    return 1<=d && d<=ndays;
  }
  ``` 
  ```c++
  const Date& Chrono::default_date()
  {
    static Date d {1,Month::jan,1970};
    return d;
  }
  ```
  - The helper function must be defined somewhere
  - A `Month` shouldn't be outside the `jan` to `dec` range, but it is possible (someone might have been sloppy with a cast), so we check.

- Overloaded Operators
  ```c++
  inline bool operator==(Date a, Date b) // equality
  {
    return a.day()==b.day() && a.month()==b.month() && a.year()==b.year();
  }

  bool operator!=(Date, Date); // inequality 
  bool operator<(Date, Date); // less than
  bool operator>(Date, Date); // greater than
  // ...

  Date& operator++(Date& d) { return d.add_day(1); } // increase Date by one day 
  Date& operator−−(Date& d) { return d.add_day(−1); } // decrease Date by one day

  Date& operator+=(Date& d, int n) { return d.add_day(n); } // add n days
  Date& operator−=(Date& d, int n) { return d.add_day(−n); } // subtract n days

  Date operator+(Date d, int n) { return d+=n; } // add n days
  Date operator−(Date d, int n) { return d+=n; } // subtract n days

  ostream& operator<<(ostream&, Date d); // output d
  istream& operator>>(istream&, Date& d); // read into d
  ``` 
  - It is often useful to add functions to enable conventional notation.
  - These operators are defined in `Chrono` together with `Date` to avoid overload problems and to **benefit from argument-dependent lookup**.
