## Operator Functions
- Defining operators for such classes sometimes allows a programmer to provide a more conventional and convenient notation for manipulating objects.
- The usual precedence rules hold.
- Overload resolution determines which, if any, interpretation is used.
- The following operators can be declared as operator functions:

|    |    |      |     |       |        |          |
|----|----|------|-----|-------|--------|----------|
| +  | -  | *    | /   | %     | ^      | &        |
| \| | ~  | !    | =   | <     | >      | +=       |
| -= | *= | /=   | %=  | ^=    | &=     | \|=      |
| << | >> | >>=  | <<= | ==    | !=     | <=       |
| >= | && | \|\| | ++  | --    | ->*    | ,        |
| -> | [] | ()   | new | new[] | delete | delete[] |

- *User-defined literals* are defined by using the `operator""` notation.
- *operator T()* defines a conversion to a type `T`.

- The following operators cannot be defined by a user
  - `::`: scope resolution
  - `.`: member selection
  - `.*`: member selection through pointer to member
  - `?:`: conditional evaluation
- It is not possible to define new operator tokens, but you can use the function call notation when this set of operators is not adequate.
- The operators `operator=` , `operator[]`, `operator()`, and `operator−>` must be non-`static` member functions.
- The default meaning of `&&,` `||`, and `,` involves sequencing: the first operand is evaluated before the second. This special rule does not hold for user-defined versions of `&&,` `||`, and `,`.
- An operator function must either be a member or take at least one argument of a user-defined type.
- It is not possible to define an operator function that operates exclusively on pointers.
- Enumerations are user-defined types so that we can define operators for them.

```c++
class complex {
  double re, im; // very simplified complex
public:
  complex(double r, double i) :re{r}, im{i} { }
  complex operator+(complex); complex operator*(complex);
};

void f()
{
  complex a = complex{1,3.1};
  complex b {1.2, 2};
  complex c {b};

  a = b+c;
  b = b+c*a;
  c = a*b+complex(1,2);
}

void f(complex a, complex b)
{
  complex c = a + b; // shorthand 
  complex d = a.operator+(b); // explicit call
}
```
- If `b` and `c` are of type `complex`, `b+c` means `b.operator+(c)`.
- A use of the operator is **only a shorthand for an explicit call** of the operator function.
```c++
void g(complex a, complex b)
{

  a = {1,2}; // OK: right hand side of assignment
  a += {1,2};  // OK: right hand side of assignment 
  b = a+{1,2}; // syntax error

  b = a + complex{1,2}; // OK
  g(a,{1,2}); // OK: a function argument is considered an initializer 
  {a,b} = {b,a}; // syntax error
}
``` 
- The `{}` notation can only be used for initializers and **on the right-hand side of an assignment**.
***
- Binary and Unary Operators
  ```c++
  class X {
  public:
    void operator+(int);
    X(int);
  };

  void operator+(X,X);
  void operator+(X,double);

  void f(X a)
  {
    a+1; // a.operator+(1)
    1+a; // ::operator+(X(1),a)
    a+1.0; // ::operator+(a,1.0)
  }
  ```
  - For any binary operator `@`, `aa@bb` can be interpreted as either
    - `aa.operator@(bb)`
    - `operator@(aa,bb)`
  ```c++
  class X {
  public: // members (with implicit this pointer):
    X* operator&(); // prefix unary & (address of) 
    X operator&(X); // binar y & (and)
    X operator++(int); // postfix increment
    X operator&(X,X); // error : ternary 
    X operator/(); // error : unary /
  };

  // nonmember functions :
  X operator−(X); // prefix unary minus
  X operator−(X,X); // binar y minus 
  X operator−−(X&,int); // postfix decrement
  X operator−();  // error: no operand 
  X operator−(X,X,X); // error: ternary
  X operator%(X);  // error : unary %
  ```
  - For any prefix unary operator `@`, `@aa` can be interpreted as either `aa.operator@()` or `operator@(aa)`.
  - For any postfix unary operator `@`, `aa@` can be interpreted as either `aa.operator@(int)` or `operator@(aa,int)`.
  - An operator can be declared only for the syntax defined for it in the grammar. For example, a user cannot define a unary % or a ternary +.
***
- Predefined Meanings for Operators
  - The operators `=`, `&` , and `,` (sequencing) have predefined meanings. 
  ```c++
  class X {
  public:
    // ...
    void operator=(const X&) = delete;
    void operator&() = delete;
    void operator,(const X&) = delete;
    // ...
  };

  void f(X a, X b)
  {
    a = b; // error: no operator=() 
    &a; // error: no operator&() 
    a,b; // error: no operator,()
  }
  ``` 
  - These predefined meanings can be eliminated by using `=delete`
***
- Passing Objects
  - For arguments, we have two main choices
    - Pass-by-value
    - Pass-by-reference
  ```c++
  void Point::operator+=(Point delta);
  ``` 
  - For small objects, say, one to four words, call-by-value is typically a viable alternative
  ```c++
  Matrix operator+(const Matrix&, const Matrix&); // pass-by-const-reference

  Matrix operator+(const Matrix& a, const Matrix& b) // return-by-value
  {
    Matrix res {a}; 
    return res+=b;
  }

  Matrix& Matrix::operator+=(const Matrix& a) // return-by-reference
  { 
    if (dim[0]!=a.dim[0] || dim[1]!=a.dim[1])
      throw std::exception("bad Matrix += argument");

    double* p = elem;
    double* q = a.elem;
    double* end = p+dim[0]*dim[1];
    while(p!=end)
      *p++ += *q++

    return *this;
  }
  ``` 
  - Larger objects, we pass by reference.
  - Returning a pointer or a reference to a newly created object is usually a very bad idea.
    - For large objects, such as a `Matrix`, define move operations to make such transfers of values efficient.
    - Operators that **return one of their argument objects** can return a reference.
***
- Operators in Namespaces
  - An operator is either a member of a class or defined in some namespace (including global namespace)
  ```c++
  namespace std { // simplified std
    class string {
      // ...
    };

    class ostream {
      // ...
      ostream& operator<<(const char*); // output C-style string
    };

    extern ostream cout;
    ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const string&); // output std::string
  } // namespace std

  int main()
  {
    const char* p = "Hello";
    std::string s = "world";
    std::cout << p << ", " << s << "!\n";
  }
  ``` 
  - Operators defined in namespaces can be found based on their operand types.
  - If `x` is of type `X` and `y` is of type `Y`, `x@y` is resolved like this:
    - If `X` is a class, look for `operator@` as a member of `X` or as a member of a base of `X`.
    - Look for declarations of `operator@` in the context surrounding `x@y`.
    - If `X` is defined in namespace `N`, look for declarations of `operator@` in `N`.
    - If `Y` is defined in namespace `M`, look for declarations of `operator@` in `M`.
  - In operator lookup **no preference** is given to members over nonmembers. This differs from lookup of named functions.
    - The lack of hiding of operators ensures that built-in operators are never inaccessible
    - Users can supply new meanings for an operator without modifying existing class declarations

## A Complex Number Type
```c++
class complex {
  double re, im;
public:
  complex& operator+=(complex a); // needs access to representation
  // ...
};

complex operator+(complex a, complex b)
{
  return a += b; // access representation through +=
}

inline complex& complex::operator+=(complex a)
{
  re += a.re;
  im += a.im;
  return *this;
}

void f(complex x, complex y, complex z)
{
  complex r1 {x+y+z}; // r1 = operator+(operator+(x,y),z)

  complex r2 {x}; // r2 = x
  r2 += y; // r2.operator+=(y)
  r2 += z; // r2.operator+=(z)
}
```
- We prefer to **minimize the number of functions that directly manipulate** the representation of an object.
  - Achieved by defining only operators that inherently modify the value of their first argument, such as +=, in the class itself.
- The arguments to this `operator+()` are **passed by value, so `a+=b` does not modify its operands.**
- Composite assignment operators such as `+=` and `*=` tend to be simpler to define than their "simple" counterparts `+` and `*`.
  - three objects are involved in a + operation (the two operands and the result).
  - Only two objects are involved in a `+=` operation
- `operator+=()` not require a temporary variable to hold the result.
```c++
class complex {
  double re, im;
public:
  complex& operator+=(complex a)
  {
    re += a.re;
    im += a.im;
    return *this;
  }

  complex& operator+=(double a)
  {
    re += a;
    return *this;
  }

  // ...
};
```
- An operator function intended to accept a built-in type as its first operand cannot be a member function.
  - Consider adding a complex variable `aa` to the integer `2`.
  - `aa+2` can be interpreted as `aa.operator+(2)`.
  - `2+aa` cannot because there is no class int for which to define `+` to mean `2.operator+(aa)`.
```c++
complex operator+(complex a, complex b)
{
  return a += b; // calls complex::operator+=(complex)
}

complex operator+(complex a, double b)
{
  return {a.real()+b,a.imag()};
}

complex operator+(double a, complex b)
{
  return {a+b.real(),b.imag()};
}

void f(complex x, complex y)
{
  auto r1 = x+y; // calls operator+(complex,complex)
  auto r2 = x+2; // calls operator+(complex,double)
  auto r3 = 2+x; // calls operator+(double,complex)
  auto r4 = 2+3; // built-in integer addition
}
```
- To cope with `2+aa`, we need *mixed-mode arithmetic*.
```c++
complex operator+(complex,complex);
complex operator+(complex,double);
complex operator+(double,complex);
// ...
```
- What if we had three alternatives for the type of each argument for each function? This can get tedious.
- The alternative to providing different versions of a function for each combination of arguments is to rely on conversions.
```c++
class complex {
  double re, im; public:

  complex() : re{0}, im{0} { }
  complex(double r) : re{r}, im{0} { }
  complex(double r, double i) : re{r}, im{i} { }
  // ...
};

bool operator==(complex,complex);

void f(complex x, complex y)
{
  x==y; // means operator==(x,y)
  x==3; // means operator==(x,complex(3))
  3==y; // means operator==(complex(3),y) 
}
``` 
- Where several variants of a function or an operator exist, the compiler must pick "the right" variant based on the argument types and the available conversions.
- An object constructed in an expression is automatic and will be destroyed at the first opportunity.
- If we don't want implicit conversions, we can use `explicit` to suppress the.
```c++
void g(complex z)
{
  3+z; // OK: complex(3)+z
  3.operator+=(z); // error : 3 is not a class object
  3+=z; // error: 3 is not a class object
}
``` 
- No implicit user-defined conversions are applied to the left-hand side of a `.` (or a `−>`).
***
- **Literals**
  - We have literals of built-in types. For example, `1.2` and `12e3` are literals of type `double`.
  - For complex, we want a literal like `1.2 + 12e3i`.
  ```c++
  class complex {
  public:
    constexpr complex(double r =0, double i =0) : re{r}, im{i} { }
    // ...
    constexpr complex<double> operator ""i(long double d)
  }

  constexpr complex<double> operator ""i(long double d)
  {
    return {0,d}; // complex is a literal type
  }

  complex z1 {1.2+12e3i};

  complex f(double d)
  {
    auto x {2.3i};
    return x+sqrt(d+12e3i)+12e3i;
  }
  ```
  - It is possible to go further and introduce a user-defined literal.
  - When constructors are simple and inline, it is quite reasonable to think of constructor invocations with literal arguments as literals.
  - This user-defined literal gives us one advantage over what we get from `constexpr` constructors.
***
- Accessor Functions
  ```c++
  class complex {
    double re, im;
  public:
    constexpr double real() const { return re; }
    constexpr double imag() const { return im; }

    void real(double r) { re = r; }
    void imag(double i) { im = i; } 
    // ...
  };
  ``` 
  - We don't consider it a good idea to provide individual access to all members of a class.
  - For many types, individual access (*get-and-set functions*) is an invitation to disaster.
***
- Helper Functions
  ```c++
  class complex {
    double re, im;
  public:
    constexpr complex(double r =0, double i =0) : re(r), im(i) { }

    constexpr double real() const { return re; }
    constexpr double imag() const { return im; }

    void real(double r) { re = r; }
    void imag(double i) { im = i; }

    complex& operator+=(complex);
    complex& operator+=(double);

    // -=, *=, and /=
  };

  /* helper */

  complex operator+(complex,complex);
  complex operator+(complex,double);
  complex operator+(double,complex);

  // binary -, *, and /

  complex operator−(complex); // unary minus complex
  operator+(complex); // unary plus

  bool operator==(complex,complex);
  bool operator!=(complex,complex);

  istream& operator>>(istream&,complex&); // input
  ostream& operator<<(ostream&,complex); // output

  complex polar(double rho, double theta);
  complex conj(complex);

  double abs(complex);
  double arg(complex);
  double norm(complex);

  double real(complex); // for notational convenience 
  double imag(complex); // for notational convenience

  complex acos(complex);
  complex asin(complex);
  complex atan(complex);
  // ...
  ```
  - From a user's point of view, the complex type presented here is almost identical to the `complex<double>` found in `<complex>` in the standard library.

## Type Conversion
- Type conversion can be accomplished by
  - A constructor taking a single argument
  - A conversion operator
- In either case the conversion can be `explicit` or implicit.
- Using a constructor is convenient but has some restriction:
  1. an implicit conversion from a user-defined type to a built-in type 
  2. a conversion from a new class to a previously defined class (without modifying the declaration for the old class)
- These problems can be handled by defining a *conversion operator* for the source type. A member function `X::operator T()`, where `T` is a type name.
- In general, it is wise to be sparing in the introduction of conversion operators.
  - **When used in excess, they lead to ambiguities**.
  - Probably the best idea is initially to **do conversions by named functions**, such as `X::make_int()`.
```c++
class Tiny {
  char v;
  void assign(int i) { if (i&~077) throw Bad_range(); v=i; }
public:
  class Bad_range { };

  Tiny(int i) { assign(i); }
  Tiny& operator=(int i) { assign(i); return *this; }

  operator int() const { return v; } // conversion to int function
};

int main()
{
  Tiny c1 = 2;
  Tiny c2 = 62;
  Tiny c3 = c2−c1; // c3 = 60
  Tiny c4 = c3; // no range check (not necessary)
  int i = c1+c2; // i = 64

  c1 = c1+c2; // range error: c1 can't be 64
  i = c3−64; // i = -4
  c2 = c3−64; // range error: c2 can't be -4
  c3 = c4; // no range check (not necessary)
}
``` 
- We define the implicit conversion from `Tiny` to `int`, `Tiny::operator int()`.
- Whenever a `Tiny` appears where an `int` is needed, the appropriate `int` is used.
```c++
Tiny::operator int() const { return v; } // right
int Tiny::operator int() const { return v; } // error
``` 
- The type being converted to is part of the name of the operator and cannot be repeated as the return value
  - In this respect, a conversion operator resembles a constructor.
```c++
int operator+(Tiny,Tiny);

void f(Tiny t, int i) {
  t+i; // error, ambiguous: "operator+(t,Tiny(i))" or "int(t)+i"?
}
```
- It is often best to rely on user-defined conversions or user-defined operators for a given type, but **not both**.
***
- `explicit` Conversion Operators
  - It is possible to declare a conversion operator explicit and have it apply only for direct initialization
  ```c++
  template <typename T, typename D = default_delete<T>>

  class unique_ptr {
  public:
    // ...
    explicit operator bool() const noexcept; // does *this hold a pointer (that is not nullptr)?
    // ...
  };

  void use(unique_ptr<Record> p, unique_ptr<int> q)
  {
    if (!p) // OK: we want this use
      throw Invalid_uninque_ptr{};

    bool b = p; // error; suspicious use 
    int x = p+q; // error; we definitly don't want this
  }
  ```
  - The standard-library `unique_ptr` has an explicit conversion to `bool`.
  - Had `unique_ptr`'s conversion to bool not been explicit, the last two definitions would have compiled.
    - The value of b would have become `true`
    - the value of x would have become `1` or `2`
***
- **Ambiguities**
  ```c++
  class X { /* ... */ X(int); X(const char*); };
  class Y { /* ... */ Y(int); };
  class Z { /* ... */ Z(X); };

  X f(X)
  Y f(Y);

  Z g(Z);

  void k1()
  {
    f(1); // error: ambiguous f(X(1)) or f(Y(1))? 
    f(X{1}); // OK
    f(Y{1}); // OK

    g("Mack"); // error: two user-defined conversions needed; g(Z{X{"Mack"}}) not tried
    g(X{"Doc"}); // OK: g(Z{X{"Doc"}})
    g(Z{"Suzy"}); // OK: g(Z{X{"Suzy"}})
  }

  class XX { /* ... */ XX(int); };

  void h(double);
  void h(XX);

  void k2()
  {
    h(1); // h(double{1}) or h(XX{1})? h(double{1})!
  }
  ``` 
  - In some cases, a value of the desired type can be constructed in more than one way; such cases are illegal.
  - User-defined conversions are considered only if a call cannot be resolved without them
  - The rules for conversion are neither the simplest to implement, nor the simplest to document, nor the most general that could be devised.
    - It is far easier to manually resolve an ambiguity than to find an error caused by an unsuspected conversion.
  ```c++
  class Quad {
  public:
    Quad(double);
    // ...
  };

  Quad operator+(Quad,Quad);

  void f(double a1, double a2)
  {
    Quad r1 = a1+a2; // double-precision floating-point adds
    Quad r2 = Quad{a1}+a2; // force quad arithmetic
  }
  ```
  ```c++
  class Real {
  public:
    operator double();
    operator int();
    // ...
  };

  void g(Real a)
  { 
    double d = a; // d = a.double();
    int i = a;  // i = a.int();

    d = a; // d = a.double();
    i = a;  // i = a.int();
  }
  ```
  - Return type is not used in overloading resolution.
  - Once the types of both sides of an initialization or assignment have been determined, both types are used to resolve the initialization or assignment.
