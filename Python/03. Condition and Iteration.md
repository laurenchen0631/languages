## Condition
```python
if expression : 
   suite
elif expression : 
   suite 
else : 
   suite
```
- Header lines begin the statement and terminate with a colon ( `:` ) and are followed by one or more lines which make up the suite.
- Python programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as `true`.
```python
#!/usr/bin/python

var = 100
if ( var == 100 ) : print "Value of expression is 100"
print "Good bye!"
```
- If the suite of an if clause consists only of a single line, it may go on the same line as the header statement.
```python
if (n := len(a)) > 10:
    print(f"List is too long ({n} elements, expected <= 10)")
```
- `:=` that assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.

## Iteration
- `while`
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python

  count = 0
  while (count < 9):
    print 'The count is:', count
    count = count + 1

  print "Good bye!"
  ```
  - A `while` loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is `true`.
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python

  count = 0
  while count < 5:
    print count, " is  less than 5"
    count = count + 1
  else:
    print count, " is not less than 5"
  ``` 
  - If the `else` statement is used with a while loop, the `else` statement is **executed when the condition becomes false**.
- `for`
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python

  for letter in 'Python':     # First Example
    print 'Current Letter :', letter

  fruits = ['banana', 'apple',  'mango']
  for fruit in fruits:        # Second Example
    print 'Current fruit :', fruit

  print "Good bye!"
  ```
  - `for` has the ability to **iterate over the items of any sequence**, such as a list or a string.
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python

  fruits = ['banana', 'apple',  'mango']
  for index in range(len(fruits)):
    print 'Current fruit :', fruits[index]

  print "Good bye!"
  ``` 
  - Use `range(start[, end])` to generate a number array that could be seemed as an index.
  ```python
  #!/usr/bin/python

  for num in range(10,20):     #to iterate between 10 to 20
    for i in range(2,num):    #to iterate on the factors of the number
      if num%i == 0:         #to determine the first factor
        j=num/i             #to calculate the second factor
        print '%d equals %d * %d' % (num,i,j)
        break #to move to the next number, the #first FOR
    else:                  # else part of the loop
      print num, 'is a prime number'
  ``` 
  - If the else statement is used with a for loop, the else statement is executed **when the loop has exhausted iterating the list**.

- Loop control
  - `break`
    - It terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement
    - The most common use for `break` is when some external condition is triggered requiring a hasty exit from a loop.
  - `continue`
    - It returns the control to the beginning of the while loop
  - `pass`
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python

    for letter in 'Python': 
      if letter == 'h':
        pass
        print 'This is pass block'
      print 'Current Letter :', letter

    print "Good bye!"
    ```
    - The `pass` statement is a null operation; **nothing happens** when it executes.
    - The `pass` is also useful in places where your code will eventually go, but has not been written yet.
