## Python 3 vs Python 2
- `print`: Python 2’s print statement has been replaced by the `print()` function. Python 3 would raise a SyntaxError if there is no parentheses.
  ```python
  # python 2
  print 'Python', python_version()
  print('Hello, World!')
  ```
  ```python
  # python 3
  print('Python', python_version())
  print('Hello, World!')
  print("some text,", end="")
  ```
- Division operator
  ```python
  # python2
  print '3 / 2 =', 3 / 2 # 1
  print '3 // 2 =', 3 // 2 # 1
  print '3 / 2.0 =', 3 / 2.0 # 1.5
  ```
  ```python
  # python 3
  print('3 / 2 =', 3 / 2) # 1.5
  print('3 // 2 =', 3 // 2) # 1
  print('3 / 2.0 =', 3 / 2.0) # 1.5
  ```
- Unicode: In Python 2, implicit str type is ASCII. But in Python 3.x implicit str type is Unicode.
- `xrange`: In Python 3, the `range()` was implemented
- `__contains__`: a “new” `__contains__` method in Python 3.x
- Handling exceptions:  In Python 3 we have to use the `as` keyword now
  ```python 
  # python2
  print 'Python', python_version()
  try:
      let_us_cause_a_NameError
  except NameError, err:
      print err, '--> our error message'
  ```
  ```python
  # python 3s
  print('Python', python_version())
  try:
      let_us_cause_a_NameError
  except NameError as err:
      print(err, '--> our error message')
  ``` 
- For-loop variables: In Python 3.x for-loop variables don’t leak into the global namespace anymore
  ```python
  # python2
  print 'Python', python_version()

  i = 1
  print 'before: i =', i

  print 'comprehension: ', [i for i in range(5)]

  print 'after: i =', i # 4
  ```
  ```python
  # python 3
  print('Python', python_version())

  i = 1
  print('before: i =', i)

  print('comprehension:', [i for i in range(5)])

  print('after: i =', i) # 1
  ```
- `input()`: the function was fixed in Python 3 so that it always stores the user inputs as `str`.  To read in other types than strings, we have to use raw_input() instead
  ```python
  # python2
  my_input = input('enter a number: ') # enter a number: 123
  type(my_input) # int
  my_input = raw_input('enter a number: ') # enter a number: 123
  type(my_input) # str
  ``` 
  ```python
  # python3
  my_input = input('enter a number: ') # enter a number: 123
  type(my_input) # str
  ``` 
- Banker’s Rounding: Python 3 adopted the now standard way of rounding decimals when it results in a tie (.5) at the last significant digits. Now, in Python 3, **decimals are rounded to the nearest even number.**
  ```python
  # python2
  round(15.5) # 16.0
  round(16.5) # 17.0
  ```
  ```python
  # python3
  round(15.5) # 16
  round(16.5) # 16
  ```


## Python 3.1
- Ordered Dictionaries
  ```python
  d = {'banana': 3, 'apple':4, 'pear': 1, 'orange': 2}

  # OrderedDict([('apple', 4), ('banana', 3), ('orange', 2), ('pear', 1)])
  OrderedDict(sorted(d.items(), key=lambda t: t[0]))

  # OrderedDict([('pear', 1), ('orange', 2), ('banana', 3), ('apple', 4)])
  OrderedDict(sorted(d.items(), key=lambda t: t[1]))
  ```
- **Thousands Separator** in `format`
  ```python
  format(1234567, ',d') # '1,234,567'
  format(1234567.89, ',.2f') # '1,234,567.89'
  format(12345.6 + 8901234.12j, ',f') # '12,345.600000+8,901,234.120000j'
  ```
  - The supported types are `int`, `float`, `complex` and `decimal.Decimal`.
- Changes
  - The fields in format() strings can now be automatically numbered
    ```python
    'Sir {} of {}'.format('Gallahad', 'Camelot')
    # 'Sir {0} of {1}'.format('Gallahad', 'Camelot')
    ```
  - `with` statement now allows multiple context managers in a single statement
    ```python
    with open('mylog.txt') as infile, open('a.out', 'w') as outfile:
      for line in infile:
        if '<critical>' in line:
          outfile.write(line)
    ```  
  - `round(x, n)` now returns an integer if `x` is an integer
  - Python now uses David Gay’s algorithm for finding the shortest floating point representation that doesn’t change its value.

## Python 3.2
- Stable ABI
  - In the past, extension modules built for one Python version were often not usable with other Python versions.
  - Extension modules built for 3.2 in that mode will also work with 3.3, 3.4, and so on.
- Command Line Parsing Module
  - `argparse` was introduced
  ```python
  import argparse
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
              description = 'Manage servers',         # main description for help
              epilog = 'Tested on Solaris and Linux') # displayed after help
  parser.add_argument('action',                       # argument name
              choices = ['deploy', 'start', 'stop'],  # three allowed values
              help = 'action on each target')         # help msg
  parser.add_argument('targets',
              metavar = 'HOSTNAME',                   # var name used in help msg
              nargs = '+',                            # require one or more targets
              help = 'url for target machines')       # help msg explanation
  parser.add_argument('-u', '--user',                 # -u or --user option
              required = True,                        # make it a required argument
              help = 'login as user')

  cmd = 'deploy sneezy.example.com sleepy.example.com -u skycaptain'
  result = parser.parse_args(cmd.split())
  result.action

  result.targets

  result.user
  ``` 
- Dictionary Based Configuration for Logging
  - To support a more flexible style, the module now offers `logging.config.dictConfig()` for specifying logging configuration with plain Python dictionaries.
  ```python
  import json, logging.config
  with open('conf.json') as f:
      conf = json.load(f)

  logging.config.dictConfig(conf)
  logging.info("Transaction completed normally")

  logging.critical("Abnormal termination")
  ``` 
- `concurrent.futures` module
  - The design for concurrent.futures was inspired by the `java.util.concurrent` package.
  - Future object supports status checks (running or done), timeouts, cancellations, adding callbacks, and access to results or exceptions.
  - Ideally, each application should share a single executor across multiple components.
  ```python
  import concurrent.futures, shutil
  with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as e:
      e.submit(shutil.copy, 'src1.txt', 'dest1.txt')
      e.submit(shutil.copy, 'src2.txt', 'dest2.txt')
      e.submit(shutil.copy, 'src3.txt', 'dest3.txt')
      e.submit(shutil.copy, 'src3.txt', 'dest4.txt')
  ``` 
  - Both classes share a common interface with three methods:
    - `submit()` for scheduling a callable and returning a Future object
    - `map()` for scheduling many asynchronous calls at a time
    - `shutdown()` for freeing resources
  - The class is a *context manager* and can be used in a `with` statement to assure that resources are automatically released

- Changes
  - format character `#`
    ```python
    format(20, '#o') # '0o24'
    format(12.34, '#5.0f') # '  12.'
    ``` 
    - Previously, for integers in binary, octal, or hexadecimal, it caused the output to be prefixed with ‘0b’, ‘0o’, or ‘0x’ respectively
    - Now it can also handle floats, complex, and Decimal, causing the output to always have a decimal point even when no digits follow it
  - `str.format_map()`
    ```python
    lcd = LowerCasedDict(part='widgets', quantity=10)
    'There are {QUANTITY} {Part} in stock'.format_map(lcd)
    # 'There are 10 widgets in stock'
    ``` 
  - `memoryview` objects now have a `release()` method and support the context management protocol.
  - Warnings are now easier to control using the `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable
    ```
    export PYTHONWARNINGS='ignore::RuntimeWarning::,once::UnicodeWarning::'
    ```
  - `range` objects now support `index` and `count` methods.
  
## Python 3.3
- Virtual Environments
  - Virtual environments help create separate Python setups while sharing a system-wide base install, for ease of maintenance.
  - It adds the `venv` module for programmatic access.
  - It adds the `pyvenv` script for command-line access and administration. 
  - The Python interpreter checks for a `pyvenv.cfg`, file whose existence signals the base of a virtual environment’s directory tree.
- Implicit Namespace Packages: Native support for package directories that **don’t require `__init__.py`** marker files and can **automatically span multiple path segments**. 
  
- Flexible String representation
  - The Unicode string type is changed to support multiple internal representations, depending on the character with the largest Unicode ordinal (1, 2, or 4 bytes) in the represented string.

- IO exception hierarchy: You don’t have to worry anymore about choosing the appropriate exception type between `OSError`, `IOError`, `EnvironmentError`, `WindowsError`,` mmap.error`, `socket.error` or `select.error`. All these exception types are now only one: `OSError`.

- Delegating to a Subgenerator
  ```python
  def g(x):
    yield from range(x, 0, -1)
    yield from range(x)
  ```
  - `yield from` expression allows a generator to delegate part of its operations to another generator.
  - This allows a section of code containing yield to be factored out and placed in another generator.
  ```python
  def accumulate():
    tally = 0
    while 1:
        next = yield
        if next is None:
            return tally
        tally += next

  def gather_tallies(tallies):
      while 1:
          tally = yield from accumulate()
          tallies.append(tally)

  tallies = []
  acc = gather_tallies(tallies)
  next(acc) # Ensure the accumulator is ready to accept values
  for i in range(4):
      acc.send(i) # 1 + 2 + 3

  acc.send(None) # Finish the first tally
  for i in range(5):
      acc.send(i) # 1+2+3+4

  acc.send(None) # Finish the second tally
  tallies # [6, 10]
  ``` 
  - Unlike an ordinary loop, `yield from` allows subgenerators to **receive sent and thrown values** directly from the calling scope, and **return a final value to the outer generator.**

- Suppressing exception context
  ```python
  class D:
    def __init__(self, extra):
        self._extra_attributes = extra
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        try:
            return self._extra_attributes[attr]
        except KeyError:
            raise AttributeError(attr) from None

  D({}).x
  ``` 
  - `raise Exception from None` allows the display of the chained exception context to be disabled.
  - Without `from None`, the original exception would be 
  ```
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 6, in __getattr__
  KeyError: 'x'

  During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "<stdin>", line 8, in __getattr__
  AttributeError: x
  ``` 
  - Original exception context remains available in `except.__context__`.
- `Explicit Unicode literals`
  -  Python 3.3 once again supports the `u` prefix for string literals.
  -  This prefix has **no semantic significance in Python 3**, it is provided solely to reduce the number of purely mechanical changes in migrating to Python 3,
- `__qualname__`
  ```python
  class C:
    class D:
        def meth(self):
            pass

  C.D.__name__ # 'D'
  C.D.__qualname__ # 'C.D'
  C.D.meth.__name__ # 'meth'
  C.D.meth.__qualname__ # 'C.D.meth'
  ``` 
  - Functions and class objects have a new `__qualname__` attribute representing the “path” from the module top-level to their definition. 

## Python 3.5
- Coroutines with async and await syntax
  - `awaitable object`s, `coroutine function`s, `asynchronous iteration`, and `asynchronous context manager`s are added.
  ```python
  async def coro():
    return 'spam'
  ``` 
  - Coroutine functions are declared using the new `async def` syntax
  - The new `await` expression can be used to suspend coroutine execution until the result is available.
  - Any object can be awaited, as long as it implements the **awaitable protocol** by defining the `__await__()` method.
  ```python
  import asyncio

  async def http_get(domain):
      reader, writer = await asyncio.open_connection(domain, 80)

      writer.write(b'\r\n'.join([
          b'GET / HTTP/1.1',
          b'Host: %b' % domain.encode('latin-1'),
          b'Connection: close',
          b'', b''
      ]))

      async for line in reader:
          print('>>>', line)

      writer.close()

  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
  try:
      loop.run_until_complete(http_get('example.com'))
  finally:
      loop.close()
  ``` 
  - `async for` statement provides convenient iteration over asynchronous iterables.
  ```python
  import asyncio

  async def coro(name, lock):
      print('coro {}: waiting for lock'.format(name))
      async with lock:
          print('coro {}: holding the lock'.format(name))
          await asyncio.sleep(1)
          print('coro {}: releasing the lock'.format(name))

  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
  lock = asyncio.Lock()
  coros = asyncio.gather(coro(1, lock), coro(2, lock))
  try:
      loop.run_until_complete(coros)
  finally:
      loop.close()
  ``` 
  - A new syntax `await with` for asynchronous context managers
  - Both `async for` and `async with` can only be used inside a coroutine function declared with `async def`.

- Infix operator for matrix multiplication
  ```python
  S = (H @ beta - r).T @ inv(H @ V @ H.T) @ (H @ beta - r)

  S = dot((dot(H, beta) - r).T,
        dot(inv(dot(dot(H, V), H.T)), dot(H, beta) - r))
  ```
  - A new `@` infix operator for *matrix multiplication*.

- Additional Unpacking Generalizations
  ```python
  print(*[1], *[2], 3, *[4, 5]) # 1 2 3 4 5
  def fn(a, b, c, d):
      print(a, b, c, d)
  fn(**{'a': 1, 'c': 3}, **{'b': 2, 'd': 4}) # 1 2 3 4
  ```
  - It is now possible to use an arbitrary number of unpackings in function calls.
  ```python
  *range(4), 4 # (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
  [*range(4), 4] # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  {*range(4), 4, *(5, 6, 7)} # {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
  {'x': 1, **{'y': 2}} # {'x': 1, 'y': 2}
  ``` 
  - Formatting support for bytes and bytearray: support for the `%` interpolation operator to `bytes` and `bytearray`.
  - Unicode is not allowed for %b, but it is accepted by %a

- **Type Hints**
  ```python
  def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello ' + name
  ``` 
  - *Function annotation* syntax has been a Python feature since version 3.0.
  - Annotations are available at runtime through the usual `__annotations__` attribute
  - **No automatic type checking happens at runtime**.

- `os.scandir()`
  ```python
  for entry in os.scandir(path):
    if not entry.name.startswith('.') and entry.is_file():
        print(entry.name)
  ```
  - `os.scandir()` is a better and faster directory iterator
  - This is largely achieved by greatly reducing the number of calls to `os.stat()` required to walk a directory tree

- A function for testing approximate equality
  ```python
  import math

  a = 5.0
  b = 4.99998
  math.isclose(a, b, rel_tol=1e-5)
  math.isclose(a, b, rel_tol=1e-6)

  math.isclose(a, b, abs_tol=0.00003)
  math.isclose(a, b, abs_tol=0.00001)
  ```
  - `math.isclose()` and `cmath.isclose()` functions tell whether two values are approximately equal or “close” to each other

## Python 3.6
- **Formatted string literals**
  ```python
  name = "Fred"
  f"He said his name is {name}."

  width = 10
  precision = 4
  value = decimal.Decimal("12.34567")
  f"result: {value:{width}.{precision}}"  # nested fields
  ``` 
  - Formatted string literals are prefixed with `f` and are similar to the format strings accepted by `str.format()`
  - The replacement fields are *expressions*, which are evaluated at run time, and then formatted using the `format()` protocol:

- Syntax for **variable annotations**
  - Python 3.5 introduced the standard for type annotations of function parameters.
  - Python 3.6 adds syntax to Python for annotating the types of variables including class variables and instance variables.
  ```python
  primes: List[int] = []
  captain: str  # Note: no initial value!
  class Starship:
      stats: Dict[str, int] = {}
  ``` 
  - Python interpreter does not attach any particular meaning to variable annotations and only stores them in the `__annotations__` attribute.
  - The goal of annotation syntax is to provide an easy way to specify structured type metadata for third party tools and libraries

- Underscores in Numeric Literals
  ```python
  1_000_000_000_000_000
  0x_FF_FF_FF_FF
  ```
  - Use *underscores (`_`)*  in numeric literals for improved readability
  - Leading, trailing, or multiple underscores in a row are not allowed.
  ```python
  '{:_}'.format(1000000) # '1_000_000'
  '{:_x}'.format(0xFFFFFFFF) # 'ffff_ffff'
  ```
  - The string formatting language also now has support for the `_` option to signal the use of an underscore.
  - For integer presentation types '`b`', '`o`', '`x`', and '`X`', underscores will be inserted *every 4 digits*.

- Asynchronous Generators
  - **Python 3.5** implementation is that it was **not possible to use** `await` and `yield` in the same function body.
  ```python
  async def ticker(delay, to):
    """Yield numbers from 0 to *to* every *delay* seconds."""
    for i in range(to):
        yield i
        await asyncio.sleep(delay)
  ``` 
  - In Python 3.6 this restriction has been lifted.

- Asynchronous Comprehensions
  ```python
  result = [i async for i in aiter() if i % 2]
  result = [await fun() for fun in funcs if await condition()]
  ```
  - Adds support for using `async for` **in list, set, dict comprehensions** and generator expressions
  - `await` expressions are supported in all kinds of comprehensions

- Simpler customization of class creation
  ```python
  class PluginBase:
    subclasses = []

    def __init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs):
        super().__init_subclass__(**kwargs)
        cls.subclasses.append(cls)

  class Plugin1(PluginBase):
      pass

  class Plugin2(PluginBase):
      pass
  ```
  - It is now possible to **customize subclass creation without using a metaclass**.
  - Custom metaclasses must ensure that the new `__classcell__` namespace entry is propagated to `type.__new__`.

- Descriptor Protocol Enhancements
  ```python
  class IntField:
    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        return instance.__dict__[self.name]

    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        if not isinstance(value, int):
            raise ValueError(f'expecting integer in {self.name}')
        instance.__dict__[self.name] = value

    # this is the new initializer:
    def __set_name__(self, owner, name):
        self.name = name

  class Model:
      int_field = IntField()
  ```
  - Descriptor protocol now includes the new optional `__set_name__()` method.
  - Whenever a new class is defined, the new method will be called.
  - Instances of descriptors can now know the attribute name of the descriptor in the owner class

- Adding a file system path protocol
  - A new interface represented by `os.PathLike` has been defined.
  - By implementing the `__fspath__()` method, an object signals that it represents a path.
  ```python
  import pathlib
  with open(pathlib.Path("README")) as f:
      contents = f.read()

  import os.path
  os.path.splitext(pathlib.Path("some_file.txt"))

  os.path.join("/a/b", pathlib.Path("c"))

  import os
  os.fspath(pathlib.Path("some_file.txt"))
  ``` 
  - The built-in `open()` function has been updated to accept `os.PathLike` objects
  - The `os.DirEntry` class and relevant classes in pathlib have also been updated to implement `os.PathLike`.

- Preserving Class Attribute Definition Order
  - Attributes in a class definition body have a natural ordering: the same order in which the names appear in the source.
  - This order is now preserved in the new class’s `__dict__` attribute

## Python 3.7
- Postponed Evaluation of Annotations
  - Annotations can be resolved at runtime using `typing.get_type_hints()`.

- Forced UTF-8 Runtime Mode
  - The new `-X utf8` command line option and `PYTHONUTF8` environment variable can be used to enable the CPython UTF-8 mode.
  - When in UTF-8 mode, CPython ignores the locale settings, and uses the UTF-8 encoding by default.

- **Built-in `breakpoint()`**
  - The new built-in `breakpoint()` function provides a easy way to enter the Python debugger.
  - Built-in `breakpoint()` calls `sys.breakpointhook()`.
  - Set `PYTHONBREAKPOINT=0` to completely disable built-in `breakpoint()`.

- Development Runtime Mode
  - The new `-X dev` command line option or the new `PYTHONDEVMODE` environment variable can be used to enable CPython’s development mode. 
  - When in development mode, CPython performs additional runtime checks.

## Python 3.8
- **Assignment expressions**
  ```python
  if (n := len(a)) > 10:
    print(f"List is too long ({n} elements, expected <= 10)")

  discount = 0.0
  if (mo := re.search(r'(\d+)% discount', advertisement)):
    discount = float(mo.group(1)) / 100.0
  ```
  - A New syntax `:=` that assigns values to variables **as part of a larger expression.** 
  ```python
  # Loop over fixed length blocks
  while (block := f.read(256)) != '':
    process(block)
  ``` 
  - The operator is also useful with while-loops that compute a value to test loop termination

- Positional-only parameters
  - There is a new function parameter syntax `/` to indicate that some function parameters must be specified positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments.
  ```python
  def f(a, b, /, c, d, *, e, f):
    print(a, b, c, d, e, f)

  f(10, 20, 30, d=40, e=50, f=60)z

  def divmod(a, b, /):
    "Emulate the built in divmod() function"
    return (a // b, a % b)
  ``` 
  - Parameters `a` and `b` are positional-only, while `c` or `d` can be positional or keyword, and `e` or `f` are required to be keywords.
  ```python
  def f(a, b, /, **kwargs):
    print(a, b, kwargs)
  f(10, 20, a=1, b=2, c=3) 
  ``` 
  - Since the parameters to the left of `/` are not exposed as possible keywords, the parameters names remain available for use in `**kwargs`

- `f'{expr=}'`
  ```python
  user = 'eric_idle'
  member_since = date(1975, 7, 31)
  f'{user=} {member_since=}' # "user='eric_idle' member_since=datetime.date(1975, 7, 31)"
  ```
  - `f'{expr=}'` will expand to the text of the expression, an equal sign, then the representation of the evaluated expression. 
  ```python
  delta = date.today() - member_since
  f'{user=!s}  {delta.days=:,d}' # 'user=eric_idle  delta.days=16,075'
  ``` 
  - *f-string format specifiers* allow more control over how the result of the expression is displayed:

## Python 3.9
- **Dictionary Merge & Update Operators**
  - Merge (`|`) and update (`|=`) operators have been added to the built-in dict class.
  - Those complement the existing `dict.update` and `{**d1, **d2}` methods of merging dictionaries.
  ```python
  x = {"key1": "value1 from x", "key2": "value2 from x"}
  y = {"key2": "value2 from y", "key3": "value3 from y"}
  x | y
  y | x
  ``` 
  - The latter dict will overwrite the content of the former dict.

- New String Methods to Remove Prefixes and Suffixe
  - `str.removeprefix(prefix)` and `str.removesuffix(suffix)` have been added

- Type Hinting Generics in Standard Collections
  ```python
  def greet_all(names: list[str]) -> None:
    for name in names:
        print("Hello", name)
  ``` 
  - You can now use **built-in collection types** such as `list` and `dict` as generic types instead of importing the corresponding capitalized types (e.g. `List` or `Dict`) from `typing`.
