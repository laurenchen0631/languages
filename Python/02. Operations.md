## Arithmetic Operators
- `+`: Adds values
- `-`: Subtracts right hand operand from left one
- `*`
- `/`
- `%`: Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder
- `**`: Performs exponential calculation
- `//`: floor division (`9//2 == 4; -11//3 == -4` )

## Assignment Operators
- `=`
- `+=`
- `-=`
- `*=`
- `/=`
- `%=`
- `**=`
- `//=`

## Comparison Operators
- `==`: If the values of two operands are equal.
- `!=`: If values of two operands are not equal.
- `<>`: If values of two operands are not equal.
- `>`: If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand
- `<`: If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand
- `>=`: If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand
- `<=`: 	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand

## Bitwise Operators
- `&`: AND
- `|`: OR
- `^`: XOR
- `~`: Binary Ones Complement
- `<<`: Binary Left Shift
- `>>`: Binary Right Shift

## Logical Operators
- `and`: If both the operands are true then condition becomes true.
- `or`: If any of the two operands are non-zero then condition becomes true.
- `not` Used to reverse the logical state of its operand.

## Membership Operators
- `in`: Evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence.
- `not in`: Evaluates to true if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence.

## Identity Operators
- `is`: Evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object.
- `is not`: Evaluates to false if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object
