## Hello worlds
```python
#!/usr/bin/python

print "Hello, Python!"
```
- Python provides no braces. **Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation**.
```python
if True:
print "Answer"
print "True"
else:
print "Answer"
print "False"
```
- This is a syntax error.
```python
total = item_one + \
        item_two + \
        item_three

days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
        'Thursday', 'Friday']
```
- Python allows the use of the line continuation character (`\`) to denote that the line should continue. 
- Statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line continuation
```python
word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
# triple quote can be composed by multiple lines
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
``` 
- Python accepts single (`'`), double (`"`) and triple (`'''` or `"""`) quotes to denote string literals.
- The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines.
- A hash sign (`#`) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. 
```python
import sys; x = 'foo'; sys.stdout.write(x + '\n')
```
- The semicolon ( `;` ) allows multiple statements on the single line

## Naming Conventions
- Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
- Starting an identifier with a *single leading underscore* indicates that the identifier is *private*.
- Starting an identifier with *two leading underscores* indicates a *strongly private* identifier.
- If the identifier also ends with *two trailing underscores*, the identifier is a **language-defined special name**.
