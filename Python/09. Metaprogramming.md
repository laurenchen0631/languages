## Metaclass
- A function, constant, variable, literally everything is an object.
- As a result, we can treat a class as any other object and pass the class as a parameter, store it, and modify it at runtime.
- A *metaclass* is above a class. It groups a set of classes together. 
```python
class FinTechExplained:
    def __init__(self, blog_name):
        self.blog_name = blog_name

    def get_blog_name(self):
        return f'Blog name is : {self.blog_name}'

print(type(FinTechExplained.get_blog_name)) # function
print(type(FinTechExplained)) # type

def FinTechExplained_init__(self, blog_name):
    self.blog_name = blog_name

fin_tech = type(
  "FinTechExplained",
  (),
  {
    "__init__": FinTechExplained_init__,
    "get_blog_name": lambda self: f'Blog name is : {self.blog_name}'
  }
)
```
- Each class is an instance of the type, `type`.
- The class `type` is a metaclass. This class is used to create other classes in the Python programming language
- We can create a class using the `type(cls, bases=None, dict=None)` constructor.
- A metaclass allows us to add special behavior to a class.
  - When we set and get a property, python calls the `__dict__.__get__` and `__set__` methods
  - If the methods do not exist then Python calls the `_getattr_` and `__set_attr__` methods.
```python
class Single(object):
    __instance = None
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls.__instance:
            cls.__instance = super().__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
        return cls.__instance
 
    def __init__(self):
        print(id(self))  # 印出來的 instance id 都是相同的
```
- `__new()__`: It’s a method which is called before __init__(). It creates the object and return it.
- `__init()__`: This method just initialize the created object passed as parameter

## Iterator
```python
for element in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(element)
for element in (1, 2, 3):
    print(element)
for key in {'one':1, 'two':2}:
    print(key)
for char in "123":
    print(char)
for line in open("myfile.txt"):
    print(line, end='')
```
- The for statement calls `iter()` on the container object.
- `iter()` returns an **iterator object** that defines the method `__next__()`.
- When there are no more elements, `__next__()` raises a `StopIteration` exception which tells the for loop to terminate.
```python
s = 'abc'
it = iter(s)

next(it)
next(it)
next(it)
next(it)
```
You can call the __next__() method using the built-in function `next()`
```python
class Reverse:
  """Iterator for looping over a sequence backwards."""
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data
    self.index = len(data)

  def __iter__(self):
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    if self.index == 0:
      raise StopIteration
    self.index = self.index - 1
    return self.data[self.index]

rev = Reverse('spam')
for char in rev:
  print(char)
```
- It is easy to add iterator behavior to your classes. Define an `__iter__()` method which returns an object with a `__next__()` method. If the class defines `__next__()`, then `__iter__()` can just return `self`.

## Generator
- Generators are a simple and powerful tool for **creating iterators**.
```python
def reverse(data):
    for index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):
        yield data[index]

for char in reverse('golf'):
    print(char)
```
- They are **written like regular functions** but use the `yield` statement to return.
- **Each time `next()` is called on it, the generator resumes where it left off**.
- What makes generators so compact is that the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods are created automatically.
- When generators terminate, they automatically raise `StopIteration`.
```python
sum(i*i for i in range(10))                 # sum of squares

xvec = [10, 20, 30]
yvec = [7, 5, 3]
sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec, yvec))         # dot product

unique_words = set(word for line in page  for word in line.split())

valedictorian = max((student.gpa, student.name) for student in graduates)

data = 'golf'
list(data[i] for i in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1))

```
- **Some simple generators can be coded succinctly as expressions using a syntax with parentheses.**
- *Generator expressions* are more compact but less versatile than full generator definitions and tend to be **more memory friendly** than equivalent list comprehensions.

## Function call
```python
class Callable(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __call__(self, greeting):
        return '{}, {}!'.format(greeting, self.name)

Callable('World')('Hello')
```
- Implementing `__call__(self[, args])` let the instance is “called” as a function.

## Context Manager
- Context managers allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to.
```python
with open('some_file', 'w') as opened_file:
    opened_file.write('Hola!')
``` 
```python
file = open('some_file', 'w')
try:
    file.write('Hola!')
finally:
    file.close()
```
- The most widely used example of context managers is the `with` statement. 
- The main advantage of using a `with` statement is that it makes sure our file is closed without paying attention to how the nested block exits.
```python
class File(object):
    def __init__(self, file_name, method):
        self.file_obj = open(file_name, method)
    def __enter__(self):
        return self.file_obj
    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
        self.file_obj.close()

with File('demo.txt', 'w') as opened_file:
    opened_file.write('Hola!')
```
- At the very least a context manager has an `__enter__` and `__exit__` method defined.
- Just by defining `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods we can use our new class in a with statement.
- `__exit__` method accepts three arguments. They are required by every `__exit__` method.
  - If an exception occurs, Python passes the `type`, `value` and `traceback` of the exception to the `__exit__` method.
  - In our case the `__exit__` method returns `None`. Therefore, the `with` statement could raise the exception.
  - If `__exit__` method returned `True`, no exception was raised by the with statement.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def open_file(name):
    f = open(name, 'w')
    try:
        yield f
    finally:
        f.close()

with open_file('some_file') as f:
  f.write('hola!')
```
- Python has a `contextlib` module for implementing Context Managers using decorators and *generators*.
