A _pointer_ is a general concept for a variable that contains an address in memory. This address refers to, or “points at,” some other data. The most common kind of pointer in Rust is a reference They don’t have any special capabilities other than referring to data, and have no overhead.

_Smart pointers_, on the other hand, are data structures that act like a pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities. Rust has a variety of smart pointers defined in the standard library that provide functionality beyond that provided by references. This pointer enables you to allow data to have multiple owners by keeping track of the number of owners and, when no owners remain, cleaning up the data.

- Smart pointers are usually implemented using structs. Unlike an ordinary struct, smart pointers implement the `Deref` and `Drop` traits.
	 - The `Deref` trait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference
	 - The `Drop` trait allows you to customize the code that’s run when an instance of the smart pointer goes out of scope.

- Many libraries have their own smart pointers, and you can even write your own. We’ll cover the most common smart pointers in the standard library:
	-   `Box<T>` for allocating values on the heap
	-   `Rc<T>`, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership
	-   `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>`, accessed through `RefCell<T>`, a type that enforces the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time

- Here is a recap of the reasons to choose `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, or `RefCell<T>`:
	- `Rc<T>` enables multiple owners of the same data; `Box<T>` and `RefCell<T>` have single owners.
	- `Box<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; `Rc<T>` allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; `RefCell<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
	- Because `RefCell<T>` allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can mutate the value inside the `RefCell<T>` even when the `RefCell<T>` is immutable.

# `Box<T>`

- Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack.
- Boxes don’t have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the heap instead of on the stack. But they don’t have many extra capabilities either.
- You’ll use them most often in these situations:
	-   When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time and you want to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size
	-   When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but ensure the data won’t be copied when you do so
	-   When you want to own a value and you care only that it’s a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type

```rust
fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b = {}", b);
}
```

- We define the variable `b` to have the value of a `Box` that points to the value `5`, which is allocated on the heap
- Just like any owned value, when a box goes out of scope, as `b` does at the end of `main`, it will be deallocated.

## Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes

- Recursive types pose an issue because at compile time Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up. However, the nesting of values of recursive types could theoretically continue infinitely.

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, List),
    Nil,
}
```

```rust
use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));
}
```

```

error: could not compile `cons-list` due to previous error
```

- The error shows this type “has infinite size.” The reason is that we’ve defined `List` with a variant that is recursive: it holds another value of itself directly. As a result, Rust can’t figure out how much space it needs to store a `List` value.

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Box::new(Cons(2, Box::new(Cons(3, Box::new(Nil))))));
}
```

- Because a `Box<T>` is a pointer, Rust always knows how much space a `Box<T>` needs: a pointer’s size doesn’t change based on the amount of data it’s pointing to
- Conceptually, we still have a list, created with lists holding other lists, but this implementation is now more like placing the items next to one another rather than inside one another

![[trpl15-02.svg]]

> Boxes provide only the indirection and heap allocation; they don’t have any other special capabilities, like those we’ll see with the other smart pointer types.


# `Deref` Trait

Implementing the `Deref` trait allows you to customize the behavior of the _dereference operator_ `*`

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x;

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

- A regular reference is a type of pointer, and one way to think of a pointer is as an arrow to a value stored somewhere else.
- If we want to make an assertion about the value in `y`, we have to use `*y` to follow the reference to the value it’s pointing to (hence _dereference_) so the compiler can compare the actual value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = Box::new(x);

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

- The main difference is that here we set `y` to be an instance of a `Box<T>` pointing to a **copied** value of `x` rather than a reference pointing to the value of `x`.
- In the last assertion, we can use the dereference operator to follow the pointer of the `Box<T>` in the same way that we did when `y` was a reference.

```rust
struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> MyBox<T> {
    fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
        MyBox(x)
    }
}

use std::ops::Deref;

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
        &self.0
    }
}


fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = MyBox::new(x);

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

> There’s one big difference between the `MyBox<T>` type we’re about to build and the real `Box<T>`: our version will not store its data on the heap.

- The `MyBox` type is a tuple struct with one element of type `T`
- The `Deref` trait, provided by the standard library, requires us to implement one method named `deref` that borrows `self` and returns a reference to the inner data.
- The `type Target = T;` syntax defines an associated type for the `Deref` trait to use.
- We fill in the body of the `deref` method with `&self.0` so `deref` returns a reference to the value we want to access with the `*` operator
- Without the `Deref` trait, the compiler can only dereference `&` references. When we entered `*y` , behind the scenes Rust actually ran `*(y.deref())`
- The reason the `deref` method returns a reference to a value, and that the plain dereference outside the parentheses in `*(y.deref())` is still necessary, is to do with the ownership system. If the `deref` method returned the value directly instead of a reference to the value, the value would be moved out of `self`

## Implicit Deref Coercions

_Deref coercion_ converts a reference to a type that implements the `Deref` trait into a reference to another type. For example, deref coercion can convert `&String` to `&str` because `String` implements the `Deref` trait such that it returns `&str`

- It happens automatically when we pass a reference to a particular type’s value as an argument to a function or method that doesn’t match the parameter type in the function
- Deref coercion was added to Rust so that programmers writing function and method calls don’t need to add as many explicit references and dereferences with `&` and `*`

```rust
fn hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {name}!");
}

fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&m);
}
```

- We’re calling the `hello` function with the argument `&m`, which is a reference to a `MyBox<String>` value. Because we implemented the `Deref` trait on `MyBox<T>`, Rust can turn `&MyBox<String>` into `&String` by calling `deref`

```rust
fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&(*m)[..]);
}
```

- If Rust didn’t implement deref coercion, we would have to call `hello` with a value of type `&MyBox<String>`.

## Mutability

- Similar to how you use the `Deref` trait to override the `*` operator on immutable references, you can use the `DerefMut` trait to override the `*` operator on mutable references.
- Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three cases:
	-   From `&T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`
	-   From `&mut T` to `&mut U` when `T: DerefMut<Target=U>`
	-   From `&mut T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`

# `Drop` Trait

You can provide an implementation for the `Drop` trait on any type, and that code can be used to release resources like files or network connections.

- In Rust, you can specify that a particular bit of code be run whenever a value goes out of scope, and the compiler will insert this code automatically. As a result, you don’t need to be careful about placing cleanup code everywhere in a program.

```rust
struct CustomSmartPointer {
    data: String,
}

impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`!", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("my stuff"),
    };
    let d = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("other stuff"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointers created.");
}
```

```

CustomSmartPointers created.
Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `other stuff`!
Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `my stuff`!
```

- The `Drop` trait is included in the prelude, so we don’t need to bring it into scope.
- Rust automatically called `drop` for us when our instances went out of scope, calling the code we specified. Variables are dropped in the reverse order of their creation, so `d` was dropped before `c`.

## Dropping a Value Early 

Occasionally, however, you might want to clean up a value early. One example is when using smart pointers that manage locks: you might want to force the `drop` method that releases the lock so that other code in the same scope can acquire the lock.

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("some data"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
    drop(c);
    println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}
```

- Rust doesn’t let you call the `Drop` trait’s `drop` method manually; This would cause a _double free_ error because Rust would be trying to clean up the same value twice.
- You have to call the `std::mem::drop` function provided by the standard library

# `Rc<T>`

There are cases when a single value might have multiple owners. For example, in graph data structures, multiple edges might point to the same node, and that node is conceptually owned by all of the edges that point to it.

- You have to enable multiple ownership explicitly by using the Rust type `Rc<T>`, which is an abbreviation for _reference counting_.
- We use the `Rc<T>` type when we want to allocate some data on the heap for multiple parts of our program to read and we can’t determine at compile time which part will finish using the data last.

> Note that `Rc<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios.

- We’ll create list `a` that contains 5 and then 10. Then we’ll make two more lists: `b` that starts with 3 and `c` that starts with 4. Both `b` and `c` lists will then continue on to the first `a`
- The `Cons` variants own the data they hold, so when we create the `b` list, `a` is moved into `b` and `b` owns `a`. Then, when we try to use `a` again when creating `c`, we’re not allowed to because `a` has been moved.

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
}
```

- We changed our definition of `List` to use `Rc<T>` in place of `Box<T>`.
- When we create `b`, instead of taking ownership of `a`, we’ll clone the `Rc<List>` that `a` is holding, thereby increasing the number of references from one to two and letting `a` and `b` share ownership of the data in that `Rc<List>`
- We need to add a `use` statement to bring `Rc<T>` into scope because it’s not in the prelude.
- We could have called `a.clone()` rather than `Rc::clone(&a)`, but Rust’s convention is to use `Rc::clone` in this case. The call to `Rc::clone` only increments the reference count, which doesn’t take much time.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    println!("count after creating a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    println!("count after creating b = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    {
        let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
        println!("count after creating c = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    }
    println!("count after c goes out of scope = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
}
```

count after creating a = 1
count after creating b = 2
count after creating c = 3
count after c goes out of scope = 2
```

- At each point in the program where the reference count changes, we print the reference count, which we get by calling the `Rc::strong_count` function.
- The `Rc<T>` type also has a `weak_count`
- When `c` goes out of scope, the count goes down by 1. We don’t have to call a function to decrease the reference count like we have to call `Rc::clone` to increase the reference count: the implementation of the `Drop` trait decreases the reference count automatically.

> `Rc<T>` allows you to share data between multiple parts of your program for reading only. f `Rc<T>` allowed you to have multiple mutable references too, you might violate one of the borrowing rules.

# `RefCell<T>`

_Interior mutability_ is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data; normally, this action is disallowed by the borrowing rules. To mutate data, the pattern uses `unsafe` code inside a data structure to bend Rust’s usual rules.

```

- A consequence of the borrowing rules is that when you have an immutable value, you can’t borrow it mutably.
- There are situations in which it would be useful for a value to mutate itself in its methods but appear immutable to other code.
- With references and `Box<T>`, the borrowing rules’ invariants are enforced at compile time. With `RefCell<T>`, these invariants are enforced _at runtime_. The `RefCell<T>` type is useful when you’re sure your code follows the borrowing rules but the compiler is unable to understand and guarantee that.

> Similar to `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios and will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in a multithreaded context

## A Use Case for Interior Mutability: Mock Objects

- Sometimes during testing a programmer will use a type in place of another type, in order to observe particular behavior and assert it’s implemented correctly. This placeholder type is called a _test double_.
- Rust doesn’t have mock object functionality built into the standard library as some other languages do. However, you can definitely create a struct that will serve the same purposes as a mock object.

```rust
pub trait Messenger {
    fn send(&self, msg: &str);
}

pub struct LimitTracker<'a, T: Messenger> {
    messenger: &'a T,
    value: usize,
    max: usize,
}

impl<'a, T> LimitTracker<'a, T>
where
    T: Messenger,
{
    pub fn new(messenger: &'a T, max: usize) -> LimitTracker<'a, T> {
        LimitTracker {
            messenger,
            value: 0,
            max,
        }
    }

    pub fn set_value(&mut self, value: usize) {
        self.value = value;

        let percentage_of_max = self.value as f64 / self.max as f64;

        if percentage_of_max >= 1.0 {
            self.messenger.send("Error: You are over your quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.9 {
            self.messenger
                .send("Urgent warning: You've used up over 90% of your quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.75 {
            self.messenger
                .send("Warning: You've used up over 75% of your quota!");
        }
    }
}
```

- We can’t modify the `MockMessenger` to keep track of the messages, because the `send` method takes an immutable reference to `self`. We also can’t take the suggestion from the error text to use `&mut self` instead, because then the signature of `send` wouldn’t match
- We’ll store the `sent_messages` within a `RefCell<T>`, and then the `send` method will be able to modify `sent_messages` to store the messages we’ve seen

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use std::cell::RefCell;

    struct MockMessenger {
        sent_messages: RefCell<Vec<String>>,
    }

        // --snip--

        assert_eq!(mock_messenger.sent_messages.borrow().len(), 1);
    }
}
```

- The `sent_messages` field is now of type `RefCell<Vec<String>>` instead of `Vec<String>`. In the `new` function, we create a new `RefCell<Vec<String>>` instance around the empty vector.
- We call `borrow_mut` on the `RefCell<Vec<String>>` in `self.sent_messages` to get a mutable reference to the value.

## Track of Borrows at Runtime

- When creating immutable and mutable references, we use the `&` and `&mut` syntax, respectively. With `RefCell<T>`, we use the `borrow` and `borrow_mut` methods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to `RefCell<T>`
- The `borrow` method returns the smart pointer type `Ref<T>`, and `borrow_mut` returns the smart pointer type `RefMut<T>`
- The `RefCell<T>` keeps track of how many `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>` smart pointers are currently active.
	- When a `Ref<T>` value goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one.
	- `RefCell<T>` lets us have many immutable borrows or one mutable borrow at any point in time.
	- If we try to violate these rules, rather than getting a compiler error as we would with references, the implementation of `RefCell<T>` will panic at runtime.

```rust
    impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            let mut one_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();
            let mut two_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();

            one_borrow.push(String::from(message));
            two_borrow.push(String::from(message));
        }
    }

- This makes two mutable references in the same scope, which isn’t allowed.
- The code panicked with the message `already borrowed: BorrowMutError`. This is how `RefCell<T>` handles violations of the borrowing rules at runtime.

## Having Multiple Owners of Mutable Data

A common way to use `RefCell<T>` is in combination with `Rc<T>`. If you have an `Rc<T>` that holds a `RefCell<T>`, you can get a value that can have multiple owners _and_ that you can mutate!

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(Rc<RefCell<i32>>, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let value = Rc::new(RefCell::new(5));

    let a = Rc::new(Cons(Rc::clone(&value), Rc::new(Nil)));

    let b = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(3)), Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(4)), Rc::clone(&a));

    *value.borrow_mut() += 10;

    println!("a after = {:?}", a);
    println!("b after = {:?}", b);
    println!("c after = {:?}", c);
}
```

- Because `Rc<T>` holds only immutable values, we can’t change any of the values in the list once we’ve created them. Let’s add in `RefCell<T>` to gain the ability to change the values in the lists.
- After we’ve created the lists in `a`, `b`, and `c`, we want to add 10 to the value in `value`. We do this by calling `borrow_mut` on `value`, which uses the automatic dereferencing feature


# Reference Cycles

Rust’s memory safety guarantees make it difficult, but not impossible, to accidentally create memory that is never cleaned up (known as a _memory leak_).  This creates memory leaks because the reference count of each item in the cycle will never reach 0, and the values will never be dropped.

```rust
use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(i32, RefCell<Rc<List>>),
    Nil,
}

impl List {
    fn tail(&self) -> Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>> {
        match self {
            Cons(_, item) => Some(item),
            Nil => None,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, RefCell::new(Rc::new(Nil))));

    println!("a initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());

    let b = Rc::new(Cons(10, RefCell::new(Rc::clone(&a))));

    println!("a rc count after b creation = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    println!("b initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
    println!("b next item = {:?}", b.tail());

    if let Some(link) = a.tail() {
        *link.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&b);
    }

    println!("b rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
    println!("a rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));

    // Uncomment the next line to see that we have a cycle;
    // it will overflow the stack
    // println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());
}
```

- The second element in the `Cons` variant is now `RefCell<Rc<List>>`, meaning that instead of having the ability to modify the `i32` value, we want to modify the `List` value a `Cons` variant is pointing to.
- This code creates a list in `a` and a list in `b` that points to the list in `a`. Then it modifies the list in `a` to point to `b`, creating a reference cycle.
- The reference count of the `Rc<List>` instances in both `a` and `b` are 2 after we change the list in `a` to point to `b`. At the end of `main`, Rust drops the variable `b`, which decreases the reference count of the `b` `Rc<List>` instance from 2 to 1. The memory that `Rc<List>` has on the heap won’t be dropped at this point, because its reference count is 1.

> If you have `RefCell<T>` values that contain `Rc<T>` values or similar nested combinations of types with interior mutability and reference counting, you must ensure that you don’t create cycles

- Another solution for avoiding reference cycles is reorganizing your data structures so that some references express ownership and some references don’t.

## Turning an `Rc<T>` into a `Weak<T>`

- You can also create a _weak reference_ to the value within an `Rc<T>` instance by calling `Rc::downgrade` and passing a reference to the `Rc<T>`
- Weak references don’t express an ownership relationship, and their count doesn’t affect when an `Rc<T>` instance is cleaned up.
- Because the value that `Weak<T>` references might have been dropped, to do anything with the value that a `Weak<T>` is pointing to, you must make sure the value still exists. Do this by calling the `upgrade` method on a `Weak<T>` instance, which will return an `Option<Rc<T>>`

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
}

fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });

    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());

    let branch = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 5,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
    });

    *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);

    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
}
```

```
leaf parent = Some(Node { value: 5, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },
children: RefCell { value: [Node { value: 3, parent: RefCell { value: (Weak) },
children: RefCell { value: [] } }] } })
```

- To make the child node aware of its parent, we need to add a `parent` field to our `Node` struct definition. The trouble is in deciding what the type of `parent` should be. We know it can’t contain an `Rc<T>`, because that would create a reference cycle with `leaf.parent` pointing to `branch` and `branch.children` pointing to `leaf`

> Thinking about the relationships another way, a parent node should own its children: if a parent node is dropped, its child nodes should be dropped as well. However, a child should not own its parent: if we drop a child node, the parent should still exist. This is a case for weak references

- So instead of `Rc<T>`, we’ll make the type of `parent` use `Weak<T>`, specifically a `RefCell<Weak<Node>>`.
- When we print the parent of `leaf`, this time we’ll get a `Some` variant holding `branch`: now `leaf` can access its parent! When we print `leaf`, we also avoid the cycle that eventually ended in a stack overflow

### weak_count

```rust
fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });

    println!(
        "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
        Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
    );

    {
        let branch = Rc::new(Node {
            value: 5,
            parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
            children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
        });

        *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);

        println!(
            "branch strong = {}, weak = {}",
            Rc::strong_count(&branch),
            Rc::weak_count(&branch),
        );

        println!(
            "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
            Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
            Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
        );
    }

    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
    println!(
        "leaf strong = {}, weak = {}",
        Rc::strong_count(&leaf),
        Rc::weak_count(&leaf),
    );
}
```
- After `leaf` is created, its `Rc<Node>` has a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 0.
- In the inner scope, we create `branch` and associate it with `leaf`, at which point when we print the counts, the `Rc<Node>` in `branch` will have a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 1
- When we print the counts in `leaf`, we’ll see it will have a strong count of 2, because `branch` now has a clone of the `Rc<Node>` of `leaf`
- When the inner scope ends, `branch` goes out of scope and the strong count of the `Rc<Node>` decreases to 0, so its `Node` is dropped. The weak count of 1 from `leaf.parent` has no bearing on whether or not `Node` is dropped, so we don’t get any memory leaks!
- If we try to access the parent of `leaf` after the end of the scope, we’ll get `None` again. At the end of the program, the `Rc<Node>` in `leaf` has a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 0, because the variable `leaf` is now the only reference to the `Rc<Node>` again.
