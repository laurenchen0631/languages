## Ownership

- A Rust compiler will automatically insert a `drop` statement to free the memory. 
  - When the owner goes out of scope, the memory is freed.
  - You cannot implement the `Copy` trait for a type that implements or contains `Drop`.

- A variable is 
  - Copied when it is in stack memory.
  - Moved when it is in heap memory. Implemented with `Drop` trait.
  - Cloned when it should be reused but in heap memory. Implemented with `Clone` trait.
  - Referenced when it is nothing to do with ownership.

```rust
struct Droppable {
    name: &'static str,
}

// This trivial implementation of `drop` adds a print to console.
impl Drop for Droppable {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("> Dropping {}", self.name);
    }
}
```
  
- Passing a variable by value will move ownership, dropping the original variable from memory since the automatic `drop`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  
    takes_ownership(s); // s's value moves into the function
    let x = 5;
    makes_copy(x); // x is copied, so it's okay to still use x
} 

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. 

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.

```

- Passing a variable by mutable reference will keep the original variable, but allow you to modify the variable.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
  
- You may only borrow a variable mutably once at a time, and you may not immutably borrow while mutably borrowing.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
    let r4 = &mut s; // error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time


    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
}
```

- You may have as many immutable borrows as you want, so long as you aren't modifying that value.
- You may mutably borrow a field in a struct, and then mutably borrow a different field in the same struct simultaneously, so long as you aren't also mutably borrowing the overall struct.
- You can use Cell and RefCell to allow for mutably modifying an immutable field in a struct.

```rust
```

- You may mutably borrow multiple slices from the same array simultaneously so long as there is no overlap.
- Safe memory practices means that instead of mutably borrowing the same variable in multiple places, you queue the changes to make in a separate location and apply them serially one after another.

## Lifetime

- `'static` denotes that the affected reference can live for the entire duration of the program.

## Pointer

- `Box<T>` allows you to store data on the heap rather than the stack.
  - Thus it won't be copied.

- `Rc<T>`
- `RefCell<T>`
- `Arc<T>`

## dyn

- Unlike other languages, if you have a trait like Animal, you can't write a function that returns Animal, because its different implementations  will need different amounts of memory.

- Instead of returning a trait object directly, our functions return a Box which contains some Animal. A box is just a reference to some memory in the heap.

```rust
struct Sheep {}
struct Cow {}

trait Animal {
    // Instance method signature
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str;
}

// Implement the `Animal` trait for `Sheep`.
impl Animal for Sheep {
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str {
        "baaaaah!"
    }
}

// Implement the `Animal` trait for `Cow`.
impl Animal for Cow {
    fn noise(&self) -> &'static str {
        "moooooo!"
    }
}

// Returns some struct that implements Animal, but we don't know which one at compile time.
fn random_animal(random_number: f64) -> Box<dyn Animal> {
    if random_number < 0.5 {
        Box::new(Sheep {})
    } else {
        Box::new(Cow {})
    }
}

fn main() {
    let random_number = 0.234;
    let animal = random_animal(random_number);
    println!("You've randomly chosen an animal, and it says {}", animal.noise());
}

```
