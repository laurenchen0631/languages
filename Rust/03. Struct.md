# Struct

A _struct_, or _structure_, is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values


```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

```

- To define a struct, we enter the keyword `struct` and name the entire struct.
- Inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of the pieces of data, which we call _fields_.

> It’s also possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of _lifetimes_

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
}
```

- To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an _instance_ of that struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields
- We don’t have to specify the fields in the same order in which we declared them in the struct.
- To get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation. For example, `user1.email`

> The entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable.


## Field Init Shorthand

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email, // we don't omit email: email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = build_user(
        String::from("someone@example.com"),
        String::from("someusername123"),
    );
}
```

- We can use the _field init shorthand_ syntax by which we don’t have to  repeat `email` and `username`
- Because the `email` field and the `email` parameter have the same name, we only need to write `email` rather than `email: email`.

## Creating Instances From Other Instances 

```rust
let user2 = User {
	email: String::from("another@example.com"),
	..user1
};
```

- The syntax `..` specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.

> In this example, we can no longer use `user1` after creating `user2` because the `String` in the `username` field of `user1` was moved into `user2`. If we had given `user2` new `String` values for both `email` and `username`, and thus only used the `active` and `sign_in_count` values from `user1`, then `user1` would still be valid

## Tuple Structs 

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
    println!(black.0)
}
```

- Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don’t have names associated with their fields
	- Tuple structs are useful When naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.

- Each struct you define is its own type, even though the fields within the struct have the same types.
- You can use a `.` followed by the index to access an individual value

## Unit-Like Structs

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
```

- You can define structs that don’t have any fields. These are called _unit-like structs_ because they behave similarly to `()`
	- Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.
- To create unit-like struct, there is no need for curly brackets or parentheses

# Struct Method

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        rect1.area()
    );
}
```

- To define the function within the context of `Rectangle`, we start an `impl` (implementation) block for `Rectangle`.
- The method syntax goes after an instance: we add a `.` followed by the method name, parentheses, and any arguments.
- In the signature for `area`, we use `&self` instead of `rectangle: &Rectangle`. The `&self` is actually short for `self: &Self`.
	- The type `Self` is an alias for the type that the `impl` block is for
	- Methods must have a parameter named `self` of type `Self` for their first parameter
- We’ve chosen `&self` here for the reason: we don’t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the data in the struct, not write to it.
- If we wanted to change the instance that we’ve called the method on as part of what the method does, we’d use `&mut self` as the first parameter

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn width(&self) -> bool {
        self.width > 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    if rect1.width() {
        println!("The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}", rect1.width);
    }
}

```

- Rust knows we mean the method `width`. When we don’t use parentheses, Rust knows we mean the field `width`.

>  Rust has a feature called _automatic referencing and dereferencing_. When you call a method with `object.something()`, Rust automatically adds in `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so `object` matches the signature of the method.

## Associated Functions

All functions defined within an `impl` block are called _associated functions_ because they’re associated with the type named after the `impl`

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
	let sq = Rectangle::square(3);
}
```

- Associated functions that aren’t methods are often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct. These are often called `new`, but `new` isn’t a special name and isn’t built into the language
- We can define associated functions that don’t have `self` as their first parameter (and thus are not methods) because they don’t need an instance of the type to work with. We’ve already used one function like this: the `String::from` function
- The `Self` keywords in the return type and in the body of the function are aliases for the type that appears after the `impl` keyword

> To call this associated function, we use the `::` syntax with the struct name; `let sq = Rectangle::square(3);`

## Multiple impl Blocks

Each struct is allowed to have multiple `impl` blocks.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}

```

# Enum
Enums are a way of defining custom data types in a different way than you do with struct.


```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}

fn main() {
    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;

    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
    route(IpAddrKind::V6);
}

fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

```

- The variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we use a double colon to separate the two, such as `IpAddrKind::V4`.

```rust
struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}

```

```rust
fn main() {
    enum IpAddr {
        V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
}

```

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}


impl Message {
	fn call(&self) {
		// method body would be defined here
	}
}

let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
m.call();
```
- We can put data directly into each enum variant.
- The name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function that constructs an instance of the enum.

# Option

`Option` is another enum defined by the standard library. The `Option` type encodes the very common scenario in which a value could be something or it could be nothing.

```rust

enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

- Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent.

```rust
fn main() {
    let some_number = Some(5);
    let some_string = Some("a string");

    let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
}
```

- You can use `Some` and `None` directly without the `Option::`
- Rust requires us to annotate the overall `Option` type: the compiler can’t infer the type that the corresponding `Some` variant will hold by looking only at a `None` value.
- `Option<T>` and `T` are different type. In other words, you have to convert an `Option<T>` to a `T` before you can perform `T` operations with it.

```rust
fn main() {
    fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            None => None,
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }

    let five = Some(5);
    let six = plus_one(five);
    let none = plus_one(None);
}
```

- We can also handle `Option<T>` using `match` as we did with the `Coin` enum


# Generic

```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

- To define the generic `largest` function, place type name declarations inside angle brackets, `<>`, between the name of the function and the parameter list.
- If we compile this code, we’ll get this error: binary operation `>` cannot be applied to type `&T`. The help text mentions `std::cmp::PartialOrd`, which is a _trait_.

## Generic Struct 

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
```

- We can also define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more fields using the `<>` syntax.

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```

- To define a `Point` struct where `x` and `y` are both generics but could have different types, we can use multiple generic type parameters.

## Generic Enum

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

## Generic Method

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

- By declaring `T` as a generic type after `impl`, Rust can identify that the type in the angle brackets in `Point` is a generic type rather than a concrete type.

```rust
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

- We can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods on the type. 
- This code means the type `Point<f32>` will have a `distance_from_origin` method; other instances of `Point<T>` where `T` is not of type `f32` will not have this method defined.

```rust
struct Point<X1, Y1> {
    x: X1,
    y: Y1,
}

impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> {
    fn mixup<X2, Y2>(self, other: Point<X2, Y2>) -> Point<X1, Y2> {
        Point {
            x: self.x,
            y: other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
}
```

- Generic type parameters in a struct definition aren’t always the same as those you use in that same struct’s method signatures.
- The method creates a new `Point` instance with the `x` value from the `self` `Point` (of type `X1`) and the `y` value from the passed-in `Point` (of type `Y2`).

# Trait

**Traits** in Rust are similar to interfaces in other languages. Traits define a set of methods that can be implemented by multiple types. 

```
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}
```

- Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.
- We declare a trait using the `trait` keyword and then the trait’s name.
- Inside the curly brackets, we declare the method signatures that describe the behaviors of the types that implement this trait, which in this case is `fn summarize(&self) -> String`.
- The compiler will enforce that any type that has the `Summary` trait will have the method `summarize` defined with this signature exactly.

```rust
use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};

pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
}
```

- Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods. The difference is that after `impl`, we put the trait name we want to implement, then use the `for` keyword.

> We can’t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can’t implement the `Display` trait on `Vec<T>` within our `aggregator` crate, because `Display` and `Vec<T>` are both defined in the standard library and aren’t local to our `aggregator` crate. This restriction is part of a property called _coherence_, and more specifically the _orphan rule_, so named because the parent type is not present.


## Default Implementations

Sometimes it’s useful to have default behavior for some or all of the methods in a trait instead of requiring implementations for all methods on every type.

```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        String::from("(Read more...)")
    }
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {}
```

- To use a default implementation to summarize instances of `NewsArticle`, we specify an empty `impl` block with `impl Summary for NewsArticle {}`.

```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
    }
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
        format!("@{}", self.username)
    }
}
```

> Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those other methods don’t have a default implementation


## Traits as Parameters

```rust
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

- Instead of a concrete type for the `item` parameter, we specify the `impl` keyword and the trait name.

## Trait Bound Syntax

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

- We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic type parameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.

## Multiple Trait

```rust
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {
```

- We can also specify more than one trait 

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
```

- The `+` syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:

## where Clauses

Using too many trait bounds has its downsides. Each generic has its own trait bounds, so functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of trait bound information between the function’s name and its parameter list, making the function signature hard to read.


```rust
fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {
```

```rust
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 where T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug, {
```

## Returning Types that Implement Traits

We can also use the `impl Trait` syntax in the return position to return a value of some type that implements a trait

```rust
fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
}
```

> However, you can only use `impl Trait` if you’re returning a single type.

```rust
fn returns_summarizable(switch: bool) -> impl Summary {
    if switch {
        NewsArticle {
            headline: String::from(
                "Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!",
            ),
            location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
            author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
            content: String::from(
                "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
                 hockey team in the NHL.",
            ),
        }
    } else {
        Tweet {
            username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
            content: String::from(
                "of course, as you probably already know, people",
            ),
            reply: false,
            retweet: false,
        }
    }
}
```

> Returning either a `NewsArticle` or a `Tweet` isn’t allowed due to restrictions around how the `impl Trait` syntax is implemented in the compiler.


## Using Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods

```rust
use std::fmt::Display;

struct Pair<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Pair<T> {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}

impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
    fn cmp_display(&self) {
        if self.x >= self.y {
            println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
        } else {
            println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
        }
    }
}
```

- `Pair<T>` only implements the `cmp_display` method if its inner type `T` implements the `PartialOrd` trait that enables comparison _and_ the `Display` trait that enables printing.
