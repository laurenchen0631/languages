# Data Type
- Rust is a _statically typed_ language: every value in Rust is of a certain _data type_.
- There are two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

## Scalar Types

A _scalar_ type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters

### Integer Types

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
|---|---|---|
| 8-bit | i8 | u8 |
| 16-bit | i16 | u16 |
| 32-bit | i32 | u32 |
| 64-bit | i64 | u64 |
| 128-bit | i128 | u128 |
| arch | isize | usize |

- Signed numbers are stored using [two’s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation.
- `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on

- Number literals allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`
| Number literals | Example |
|---|---|
| Decimal | 98_222 |
| Hex | 0xff |
| Octal | 0o77 |
| Binary | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (u8 only) | b'A' |

> Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`

### Floating-Point 

- Rust’s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively.
	- The `f32` type is a single-precision float
	- The `f64` has double precision.
- The default type is `f64`

### Boolean
- The Boolean type in Rust is specified using `bool`. 
- Boolean type has two possible values: `true` and `false`.
- Booleans are one byte in size.

### Character
- Rust’s `char` type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type
- Rust’s `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value

> We specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes

> A “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a `char` is in Rust


## Compound Types

_Compound types_ can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

### Tuple

- A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types
- Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they **cannot** grow or shrink in size.

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
    println!("The value of x is: {}", tup.0);
}
```

- We can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value.
- We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the value

> The tuple without any values, `()`, is is called the _unit type_ and the value is called the _unit value_. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.


### Array

- Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
- Arrays in Rust have a **fixed** length.

- You write an array’s type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array.
```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

- You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for many times.
```rust
let a = [3; 5]; // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

# Variables

## let

- By default variables are immutable. However, you can make them mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable name.

```rust
let x = 5;
println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
x = 6; // Compile-time error

let mut y = 5;
y = 6;
```

- You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable. We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the use of the `let`.
	- The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again
	- The new variable don't need to be the same type as before.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x);
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

```

## const

- _Constants_ are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants and variables.
	- You aren’t allowed to use `mut`.
	- Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope.
	- Constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.

- You declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value _must_ be annotated.

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

# Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}

```

> Rust code uses _snake case_ as the conventional style for function and variable names

- The `main` function is the entry point of many programs.
- We define a function in Rust by entering `fn` followed by a function name and a set of parentheses.


## Parameters

```rust
fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {}{}", value, unit_label);
}
```

- In function signatures, you _must_ declare the type of each parameter.
- When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas.

## Statements and Expressions

> Rust is an **expression-based** language.

- _Statements_ are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
	- `let y = 6;` is a statement.
	- Function definitions are also statements
	- Statements do not return values: `let x = (let y = 6);` is an error.

- _Expressions_ evaluate to a resulting value.
	- `5 + 6` is an expression that evaluates to the value `11`.
	- Expressions can be part of statements
	- Calling a function is an expression.
	- Calling a macro is an expression
	- A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}

```

> Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement

## Return

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

```

- We don’t name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (`->`).
- In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the **final expression in the block** of the body of a function.
- You can return early from a function by using the `return` keyword


# Control Flow

## if

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}

```

- Condition _must_ be a `bool`. If the condition isn’t a `bool`, we’ll get an error.

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

- Because `if` is an **expression**, we can use it on the right side of a `let` statement to assign the outcome to a variable
- Expression results from each arm of the `if` must be the same type.

### if let

```rust
fn main() {
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
    }
}

```

- The syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign. It works the same way as a `match`
- You can think of `if let` as syntax sugar for a `match` that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.

## match

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => {
	        println!("Lucky penny!");
	        1
	    }
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}
```

- When the `match` expression executes, it compares the resulting value against the pattern of each arm, in order.
- If you want to run multiple lines of code in a match arm, you must use curly brackets.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska));
}

```

- Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 13;
    match number {
        1 => println!("One!"),
        // Match several values
        2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 => println!("This is a prime"),
        // Match an inclusive range
        13..=19 => println!("A teen"),
        // Handle the rest of cases
        _ => (),
    }
}

```

> Matches in Rust are _exhaustive_: we must exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid

- To match all possibility, we can use a variable to match any condition. The variable can be `_`, `other`, and anything.

## loop

```
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

- The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.
	- You can place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop executing the loop
	- We can use `continue` to skip over any remaining code in this iteration and go to the next iteration.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {}", count);
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {}", remaining);
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {}", count);
}
```

- You can optionally specify a _loop label_ on a loop that we can then use with `break` or `continue` to specify that those keywords apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);
}

```

- You can add the value you want returned after the `break` expression you use to stop the loop,

## while

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

- It’s possible to implement behavior like this using a combination of `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`

## for

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }

	for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }

}

```

# Collection

## Vec

```rust
fn main() {
    let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
}
```

- `Vec<T>`, also known as a _vector_, allows you to store more than one value in a single data structure
- To create a new empty vector, we call the `Vec::new` function.
- Rust conveniently provides the `vec!` macro, which will create a new vector that holds the values you give it.
- When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning those integers it holds will be cleaned up.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = Vec::new();

    v.push(5);
    v.push(6);
    v.push(7);
    v.push(8);
}
```

- If we want to be able to change its value, we need to make it mutable using the `mut` keyword

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let third: &i32 = &v[2];
    println!("The third element is {}", third);

    match v.get(2) {
        Some(third) => println!("The third element is {}", third),
        None => println!("There is no third element."),
    }
}

```

- There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: 
	1. indexing
	2. `get` method: gives us an `Option<&T>`

- `[]` method will cause the program to panic when it references a nonexistent element.
- When the `get` method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns `None` without panicking.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
	for i in &v {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
    for i in &mut v {
        *i += 50;
    }
}
```

- We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable vector in order to make changes to all the elements


## Multiple Types

Vectors can only store values that are the same type. This can be inconvenient; there are definitely use cases for needing to store a list of items of different types.

```rust
fn main() {
    enum SpreadsheetCell {
        Int(i32),
        Float(f64),
        Text(String),
    }

    let row = vec![
        SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
        SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
        SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
    ];
}

```

- We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different value types, and all the enum variants will be considered the same type.
  - If you don’t know the exhaustive set of types a program will get at runtime to store in a vector, the enum technique won’t work. Instead, you can use a trait object.

# String

- Rust has only one string type in the core language, which is the string slice `str` that is usually seen in its borrowed form `&str`
- The `String` type, which is provided by Rust’s standard library rather than coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type.
- Rust’s standard library also includes a number of other string types, such as `OsString`, `OsStr`, `CString`
	- `Str` and `String` refer to owned and borrowed variants

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::new();

	let data = "initial contents";
    let s = data.to_string();

    // the method also works on a literal directly:
    let s = "initial contents".to_string();

    let s = String::from("initial contents");
}
```

- We can create `String` using `String::new()` as `Vec<T>`.
- We can also use `.to_string()` method on string literal to create `String`.
- We can also use the function `String::from` to create a `String` from a string literal.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("foo");
    s.push_str("bar");
    s.push('l');
    
}
```

- We can grow a `String` by using the `push_str` method to append a string slice.

- The `push` method takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to the `String`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
    let s2 = String::from("world!");
    let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
	
	let s = s1 + "-" + &s2 + "-" + &s3;
}
```

- You can combine two existing strings using the `+` operator.
- The `+` operator uses the `add` method, whose signature looks something like `fn add(self, s: &str) -> String`
	- `s2` has an `&`, meaning that we’re adding a _reference_ of the second string to the first string
	- The compiler can _coerce_ the `&String` argument into a `&str`. When we call the `add` method, Rust uses a _deref coercion_, which here turns `&s2` into `&s2[..]`.
	- We can see in the signature that `add` takes ownership of `self`, because `self` does _not_ have an `&`. This means `s1` will be moved into the `add` call and will no longer be valid.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("tic");
    let s2 = String::from("tac");
    let s3 = String::from("toe");

    let s = format!("{}-{}-{}", s1, s2, s3);
}

```
- For more complicated string combining, we can instead use the `format!` macro.
- The `format!` macro works like `println!`, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a `String` with the contents.

`
```rust
fn main() {
	let hello = "Здравствуйте";
	let answer = &hello[0];

    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let h = s1[0];
}
```

> If you try to access parts of a `String` using indexing syntax in Rust, you’ll get an error. Rust strings don’t support indexing.

- The length of `Здравствуйте` is 24 (bytes) in Rust because each Unicode scalar value in that string takes 2 bytes of storage.
- When encoded in UTF-8, the first byte of `З` is `208` and the second is `151`, so it would seem that `answer` should in fact be `208`, but `208` is not a valid character on its own.

- There are actually three relevant ways to look at strings from Rust’s perspective: as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme clusters.
	- Take the Hindi word “नमस्ते” for example.
	- Vector: `[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164, 224, 165, 135]`. That’s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data.
	- Unicode scalar: `['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']`. There are six `char` values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters: they’re diacritics.
	- Grapheme cluster: `["न", "म", "स्", "ते"]`

```rust
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let s = &hello[0..4];
```
- If you really need to use indices to create string slices, therefore, Rust asks you to be more specific. You can use `[]` with a range to create a string slice.

> If we were to try to slice only part of a character’s bytes with something like `&hello[0..1]`, Rust would panic at runtime


```rust
for c in "नमस्ते".chars() {
    println!("{}", c); // न म स ् त े
}

for b in "नमस्ते".bytes() {
	println!("{}", b); // 224 164 ... 165 135
}
```

- Getting grapheme clusters from strings is complex, so this functionality is not provided by the standard library.

# HashMaps
```rust
fn main() {
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
}
```

- One way to create an empty hash map is using `new` and adding elements with `insert`.
- Like vectors, hash maps store their data on the **heap**.
- Like vectors, hash maps are homogeneous: all of the keys must have the same type, and all of the values must have the same type.
- For owned values, the values will be moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values

```rust
fn main() {
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let teams = vec![String::from("Blue"), String::from("Yellow")];
    let initial_scores = vec![10, 50];

    let mut scores: HashMap<_, _> =
        teams.into_iter().zip(initial_scores.into_iter()).collect();
}
```

- Another way of constructing a hash map is by using iterators and the `collect` method on a vector of tuples.
- We could use the `zip` method to create an iterator of tuples where “Blue” is paired with 10.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name);

for (key, value) in &scores {
	println!("{}: {}", key, value);
}
```

- The `get` result is wrapped in `Some` because `get` returns an `Option<&V>`. If there’s no value for that key in the hash map, `get` will return `None`.

```rust
fn main() {
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

	scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
	scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);
}
```

- When you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how to handle the case when a key already has a value assigned.
	- You could replace the old value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value.
	- You could keep the old value and ignore the new value

- Hash maps have a special API for this called `entry` that takes the key you want to check as a parameter. The return value of the `entry` method is an enum called `Entry` that represents a value that might or might not exist.
- The `or_insert` method on `Entry` is defined to return a mutable reference to the value for the corresponding `Entry` key if that key exists.

```rust
fn main() {
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let text = "hello world wonderful world";

    let mut map = HashMap::new();

    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
        *count += 1;
    }

    println!("{:?}", map);
}
```

- Another common use case for hash maps is to look up a key’s value and then update it based on the old value.
- In order to assign to that value, we must first dereference `count` using the asterisk (`*`).
