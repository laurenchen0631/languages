# Ownership

- _Ownership_ is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory. Rust uses an approach: memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks.
	- Some languages have garbage collection that constantly looks for no-longer used memory as the program runs
	- In other languages, the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory. 

## The Stack and the Heap

In rust, whether a value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why you have to make certain decisions

- The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order.
	- Adding data is called _pushing onto the stack_
	- Removing data is called _popping off the stack_.
	- All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size.

- The heap is less organized
	- You request a certain amount of space. 
	- The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a _pointer_.
	- Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap.
	- Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack

- Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data.


> Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses.


## Rules

- Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its _owner_.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid.
```rust
{                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
	let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

	// do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

`String` manages data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
}
```

> The double colon `::` operator allows us to namespace this particular `from` function

## Memory and Allocation

- With the `String` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents.
	- When we call `String::from`, its implementation requests the memory it needs.

- Rust automatically returned memory once the variable that owns it goes out of scope. Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing curly bracket.


```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
println!("{}, world!", s1); // error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`
```

- When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to.
	- This is a problem: when `s2` and `s1` go out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a _double free_ error
	- To ensure memory safety, after the line `let s2 = s1`, Rust considers `s1` as no longer valid.

![[trpl04-04.svg]]
> Because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of calling it a shallow copy, it’s known as a _move_.

### Clone

If we _do_ want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
}
```

### Copy
- We now have two variables, `x` and `y`, and both equal `5`. This is indeed what is happening, because integers are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two `5` values are pushed onto the stack.
- The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make.
- Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack
- Rust won’t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`, can be copied.

## Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.

```

- Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does.
- If we tried to use `s` after the call to `takes_ownership`, Rust would throw a compile-time error


```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}

```
- Returning values can also transfer ownership.
- When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by `drop` unless ownership of the data has been moved to another variable.

> Taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. Rust has a feature for using a value without transferring ownership, called _references_.


# Reference

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

- A _reference_ is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access data stored at that address that is owned by some other variable.
- Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type.
- The `&s1` syntax lets us create a reference that _refers_ to the value of `s1` but does not own it. Likewise, the signature of the function uses `&` to indicate that the type of the parameter `s` is a reference.

> We call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_.


```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world"); // error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*some_string` as mutable
} 
```

- We’re not allowed to modify something we have a reference to.



## Mutable References

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

- We create a mutable reference with `&mut s` where we call the `change` function, and update the function signature to accept a mutable reference with `some_string: &mut String`

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s; // error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time

    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
}

```

- Mutable references have one big **restriction**: you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data at a time.
	- The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
}

```
- Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references.
	- Multiple immutable references are allowed.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
}
```

- Note that a reference’s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used
	- The scopes of the immutable references `r1` and `r2` end after the `println!`

> The ability of the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope is called _Non-Lexical Lifetimes_ (NLL for short)


> if we have an immutable reference to something, we cannot also take a mutable reference.

## Dangling References

> In languages with pointers, it’s easy to erroneously create a _dangling pointer_ -- a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else -- by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory

- In Rust, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String { // error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
    let s = String::from("hello");

    &s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
```

- Because `s` is created inside `dangle`, when the code of `dangle` is finished, `s` will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means this reference would be pointing to an invalid `String`

# Slice

- _Slices_ let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.
- A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");

    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
}

```

![[trpl04-06.svg]]

- We create slices using a range within brackets by specifying `[starting_index..ending_index]`
	- `starting_index` is the first position in the slice
	- `ending_index` is one more than the last position in the slice.

- If you want to start at index zero, you can drop the value before the two periods: `&s[0..2]`
- If your slice includes the last byte of the `String`, you can drop the trailing number: `&s[3..];`

> String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character boundaries. If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a multibyte character, your program will exit with an error.


```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

```rust
let s = "Hello, world!";
```

- The type of `s` here is `&str`: it’s a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable

```rust

fn main() {
	let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
	let slice = &a[1..3];
	assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);
}


```
- Just as we might want to refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer to part of an array.
- This slice has the type `&[i32]`.
